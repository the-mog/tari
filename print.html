<p>Tari is a community-driven project. The documents presented in this RFC collection have typically gone through several
iterations before reaching this point:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ideas and questions are posted in #tari-dev on <a href="https://freenode.net/">#FreeNode IRC</a>. This is typically short-form
content with rapid feedback. Often, these conversations will lead to someone posting an <a href="https://github.com/tari-project/tari/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3ARFC" title="Tari RFC Issues">issue</a> or RFC <a href="https://github.com/tari-project/tari/pulls?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Apr+label%3ARFC" title="Tari RFC pull requests">pull request</a>.</li>
<li>RFCs are &quot;Requests for Comment&quot;, so although the proposals in these documents are usually well-thought out, they are
not cast in stone. RFCs can, and should, undergo further evaluation and discussion by the community. RFC comments are
best made using Github <a href="https://github.com/tari-project/tari/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3ARFC" title="Tari RFC Issues">issue</a>s.</li>
</ul>
<p>New RFC's should follow the format given in the <a href="./RFC_template.html">RFC template</a>.</p>
<h2 id="lifecycle"><a class="header" href="#lifecycle">Lifecycle</a></h2>
<p>RFCs go through the following lifecycle, which roughly corresponds to the <a href="https://rfc.unprotocols.org/spec:2/COSS/">COSS</a>:</p>

<p>The Tari network comprises three layers:</p>
<ol>
<li>A base layer that deals with <a href="Glossary.html#tari-coin">Tari coin</a> <a href="Glossary.html#transaction">transaction</a>s. It governed by a proof-of-work (PoW) blockchain that is merged-mined with
Monero. The base layer is highly secure, decentralized and relatively slow.</li>
<li>A multiparty payments channel that allows rapid, secure, low-cost, off-chain payments that are periodically settled on the
base layer.</li>
<li>A digital assets network (DAN) that manages all things to do with native digital assets. It is built for liveness,
speed and scalability at the expense of decentralization.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="theme/images/tari_network_overview.png" alt="Tari Network Overview" /></p>
<h3 id="currency-tokens-and-digital-assets"><a class="header" href="#currency-tokens-and-digital-assets">Currency Tokens and Digital Assets</a></h3>
<p>There are two major digital entities on the Tari network: the coins that are the unit of transfer for the Tari
cryptocurrency, and the digital assets that could represent anything from tickets to in-game items.</p>
<p>Tari coins are the fuel that drives the entire Tari ecosystem. They share many of the properties of money, so
security is a non-negotiable requirement. In a cryptocurrency context, this is usually achieved by employing a
decentralized network running a censorship-resistant protocol such as Nakamoto consensus over a proof-of-work blockchain.
As we know, PoW blockchains are not scalable or very fast.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the Tari network will be used to create and manage digital assets.</p>
<p>In Tari parlance, a digital asset is defined as a finite set of digital stateful tokens that are governed by predefined
rules. A single digital asset may define anything from one to thousands of tokens within its scope.</p>
<p>For example, in a ticketing context, an <em>event</em> will be an asset. The asset definition will allocate tokens representing
the tickets for that event. The ticket tokens will have state, such as its current owner and whether or not it has been
redeemed. Users might be interacting with digital assets hundreds of times a second, and state updates need to be
propagated and agreed upon by the network very quickly. A blockchain-enabled ticketing system is practically useless if
a user has to wait for &quot;three block confirmations&quot; before the bouncer will let her into a venue. Users expect near-instant
state updates because centralized solutions offer them that today.</p>
<p>Therefore the Tari DAN must offer speed and scalability.</p>
<h4 id="multiple-layers"><a class="header" href="#multiple-layers">Multiple Layers</a></h4>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAP_theorem">distributed system trilemma</a> tells us that these requirements are
mutually exclusive.</p>
<p>We can't have fast, cheap digital assets and also highly secure and decentralized currency tokens on a single system.</p>
<p>Tari overcomes this constraint by building three layers:</p>
<ol>
<li>A base layer that provides a public ledger of Tari coin transactions, secured by PoW to maximize security.</li>
<li>A multiparty payment channel that allows funds to be sent to parties in the channel instantly, securely and with very
low fees.</li>
<li>A DAN that manages the state of digital assets. It is very fast and cheap, at the expense of
decentralization.</li>
</ol>
<p>If required, the digital assets layer can refer back to the base layer to temporarily give up speed in exchange for
increased security. This fallback is used to resolve consensus issues on the digital assets layer that may crop up from
time to time as a result of the lower degree of decentralization.</p>
<h3 id="base-layer"><a class="header" href="#base-layer">Base Layer</a></h3>
<p><em>Refer to <a href="RFC-0100_BaseLayer.html">RFC-0100/BaseLayer</a> for more detail</em>.</p>
<p>The Tari base layer has the following primary features:</p>
<ul>
<li>PoW-based blockchain using Nakamoto consensus</li>
<li>Transactions and blocks based on the <a href="Glossary.html#mimblewimble">Mimblewimble</a> protocol</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="Glossary.html#mimblewimble">Mimblewimble</a> is an exciting new blockchain protocol that offers some key advantages over other <a href="Glossary.html#unspent-transaction-outputs">UTXO</a>-based
cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin:</p>
<ul>
<li>Transactions are private. This means that casual observers cannot ascertain the amounts being transferred or the
identities of the parties involved.</li>
<li>Mimblewimble employs a novel blockchain &quot;compression&quot; method called cut-through, which dramatically reduces the

<h4 id="proof-of-work"><a class="header" href="#proof-of-work">Proof of Work</a></h4>
<p>There are a few options for the PoW mechanism for Tari:</p>
<ul>
<li>Implement an existing PoW mechanism. This is a bad idea, because a nascent cryptocurrency that uses a non-unique
mining algorithm is incredibly vulnerable to a 51% attack from miners from other currencies using the same algorithm.
Bitcoin Gold and Verge have already experienced this, and it's a <a href="https://www.crypto51.app/">matter of time</a> before it
happens to others.</li>
<li>Implement a unique PoW algorithm. This is a risky approach and comes close to breaking the number one rule of
cryptocurrency design: never roll your own crypto.</li>
<li><a href="https://tari-labs.github.io/tari-university/merged-mining/merged-mining-scene/MergedMiningIntroduction.html">Merged mining</a>.
This approach is not without its own risks, but offers the best trade-offs in terms of bootstrapping the network. It
typically provides high levels of hash rate from day one, along with 51% attack resistance, assuming mining pools are
well-distributed.</li>
<li>A hybrid approach, utilizing two or more of the above mechanisms.</li>
</ul>
<p>Given Tari's relationship with Monero, a merged-mining strategy with Monero makes the most sense. However, the PoW mechanism
SHOULD be written in a way that makes it relatively easy to code, implement and switch to a different strategy in the
future.</p>
<h3 id="multiparty-payment-channel"><a class="header" href="#multiparty-payment-channel">Multiparty Payment Channel</a></h3>
<p>Further details about the Tari multiparty payment channel technology are given in
<a href="RFC-0500_PaymentChannels.html">RFC-500/PaymentChannels</a>.</p>
<h3 id="digital-assets-network"><a class="header" href="#digital-assets-network">Digital Assets Network</a></h3>
<p>A more detailed proposal for the DAN is presented in <a href="RFC-0300_DAN.html">RFC-0300/DAN</a>. Digital assets
<em>are discussed in more detail in <a href="RFC-0311_AssetTemplates.html">RFC-0310/Assets</a>.</em></p>
<p>The Tari DAN consists of a peer-to-peer network of <a href="Glossary.html#validator-node">Validator nodes</a>. These nodes ensure the
safe and efficient operation of all native digital assets on the Tari network.</p>
<p>Validator nodes are responsible for:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Registering</em> themselves on the base layer.</li>
<li>Validating and executing the contracts that <em>create</em> and issue <em>new digital assets</em> on the network.</li>
<li>Validating and executing <em>instructions</em> for <em>changes in state</em> of digital assets, e.g. allowing the transfer of
ownership of a token from one person to another.</li>
<li><em>Maintaining consensus</em> with other validator nodes managing the same asset.</li>
<li>Submitting periodic <em>checkpoints</em> to the base layer for the state of assets under their management.</li>
</ul>
<p>The DAN is focused on achieving high speed and scalability, without compromising on security. To achieve
this, we make the explicit trade-off of sacrificing decentralization.</p>
<p>In many ways this is desirable, since the vast majority of assets (and their issuers) don't need or want <em>the entire
network</em> to validate every state change in their asset contracts.</p>
<p>Digital assets necessarily have <em>state</em>. Therefore the digital assets layer must have a means of synchronizing and
agreeing on state that is managed simultaneously by multiple servers, i.e. reaching consensus.</p>
<p>Please refer to Tari Labs University (TLU) for detailed discussions on
<a href="https://tlu.tarilabs.com/layer2scaling/layer2scaling-landscape/layer2scaling-survey.html">layer 2 scaling solutions</a>
and
<a href="https://tlu.tarilabs.com/consensus-mechanisms/BFT-consensus-mechanisms-applications/Introduction.html">consensus mechanisms</a>.</p>
<h3 id="interaction-between-base-layer-and-digital-assets-network"><a class="header" href="#interaction-between-base-layer-and-digital-assets-network">Interaction between Base Layer and Digital Assets Network</a></h3>
<p>The base layer provides supporting services to the DAN. In general, the base layer only knows about
Tari coin transactions. It knows nothing about the details of any digital assets and their state.</p>
<p>This is by design: the network cannot scale if details of digital asset contracts have to be tracked on the base layer.
We envisage that there could be tens of thousands of contracts deployed on Tari. Some of those contracts may be enormous;
imagine controlling every piece of inventory and their live statistics for a massively multiplayer online role-playing 
game (MMORPG). The base layer is also too slow. If <em>any</em> state relies on base layer transactions being confirmed, there 
is an immediate lag before that state change can be considered final, which kills the liveness properties we seek for the DAN.</p>
<p>It is better to keep the two networks almost totally decoupled from the outset, and allow each network to play to its
strength.</p>
<p>That said, there are key interactions between the two layers. The base layer is a ledger and can be used as a
source of truth for the DAN to use as a type of registrar as well as final court of appeal in the case of consensus
disputes. This is what gives the DAN a secure fallback should bad actors try to manipulate asset state by taking
advantage of its non-decentralization.</p>
<p>These interactions require making provision for additional transaction types, in addition to payment and coinbase
transactions, which mark validator node registrations, contract collateral, etc.</p>
<p>The interplay between base layer and DAN is what incentivizes every actor in the system to maintain an efficient and
well-functioning network, even while acting in their own self-interest.</p>
<h3 id="summary"><a class="header" href="#summary">Summary</a></h3>

<h2 id="goals-1"><a class="header" href="#goals-1">Goals</a></h2>
<p>The aim of this Request for Comment (RFC) is to describe and explain the Tari codebase layout.</p>
<h2 id="related-requests-for-comment-1"><a class="header" href="#related-requests-for-comment-1">Related Requests for Comment</a></h2>
<p>None.</p>

<p>The code follows a Domain-driven Design (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design" title="Wikipedia: Domain Driven Design">DDD</a>) layout, with top-level directories falling into infrastructure, domain
and application layers.</p>
<h3 id="infrastructure-layer"><a class="header" href="#infrastructure-layer">Infrastructure Layer</a></h3>
<p>The infrastructure layer provides a set of crates that have general infrastructural utility. The rest of the Tari codebase can make use
of these crates to obtain persistence, communication and cryptographic services. The infrastructure layer doesn't know
anything about blockchains, transactions or digital assets.</p>
<p>We recommend that code in this layer generalizes infrastructure services behind abstraction layers as much as is
reasonable, so that specific implementations can be swapped out with relative ease.</p>
<h3 id="domain-layer"><a class="header" href="#domain-layer">Domain Layer</a></h3>
<p>The domain layer houses the Tari &quot;business logic&quot;. All protocol-related concepts and procedures are defined and
implemented here.</p>
<p>This means that any and all terms defined in the <a href="../Glossary.html" title="Glossary">Glossary</a> will have a software implementation here, and only here.
They can be <em>used</em> in the application layer, but must be <em>implemented</em> in the domain layer.</p>
<p>The domain layer can make use of crates in the infrastructure layer to achieve its goals.</p>
<h3 id="application-layer"><a class="header" href="#application-layer">Application Layer</a></h3>
<p>In the application layer, applications build on top of the domain layer to produce the executable software that is 
deployed as part of the Tari network.</p>
<p>As an example, the following base layer applications may be developed as part of the Tari protocol release:</p>
<ul>
<li>A standalone miner (tari_miner)</li>
<li>A pool miner (tari_pool_miner)</li>
<li>A Command Line Interface (CLI) wallet for the Tari cryptocurrency (cli_wallet)</li>
<li>A base node executable (tari_basenode)</li>
<li>A REST Application Programming Interface (API) server for the base node</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="code-layout"><a class="header" href="#code-layout">Code Layout</a></h3>
<p>The top-level source code directories in this repository reflect the respective <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design" title="Wikipedia: Domain Driven Design">DDD</a> layers; except that there are two
domain layer directories, corresponding to the two network layers that make up the Tari network.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The <code>infrastructure</code> directory contains application-layer code and is not Tari-specific. It holds the following
crates:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>comms</code> - the networking and messaging subsystem;</li>
<li><code>crypto</code> - all cryptographic services, including a Curve25519 implementation;</li>
<li><code>storage</code> - data persistence services, including a Lightning Memory-mapped Database (LMDB) persistence implementation;</li>
<li><code>merklemountainrange</code> - an independent implementation of a Merkle Mountain Range;</li>
<li><code>derive</code> - a crate to contain <code>derive(...)</code> macros.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>base_layer</code> is a domain-layer directory and contains:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>blockchain</code> - the Tari consensus code;</li>
<li><code>core</code> - common classes and traits, such as <a href="../Glossary.html#transaction">Transaction</a>s and <a href="../Glossary.html#block">Block</a>s;</li>
<li><code>mempool</code> - the unconfirmed transaction pool implementation;</li>
<li><code>mining</code> - the merged-mining modules;</li>
<li><code>p2p</code> - the block and transaction propagation module;</li>
<li><code>api</code> - interfaces for clients and wallets to interact with the base layer components.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>digital_assets_layer</code> is a domain-layer directory. It contains code related to the management of native Tari digital
assets. Its substructure is to be determined.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>applications</code> contains crates for all the application-layer executables that form part of the Tari codebase.</p>

<p>The Tari Base Layer network comprises the following major pieces of software:</p>
<ul>
<li>Base Layer full node implementation. The base layer full nodes are the consensus-critical pieces of software for the
Tari base layer and cryptocurrency. The base nodes validate and transmit transactions and blocks, and maintain
consensus about the longest valid proof-of-work blockchain.</li>
<li>Mining software. Mining nodes perform proof-of-work to secure the base layer and compete to submit the
next valid block into the Tari blockchain. Tari is merge-mined with Monero. The Tari source provides two alternatives
for Tari miners:
<ul>
<li>A standalone miner</li>
<li>A stratum-compatible pool miner.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Wallet software. Client software and Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) offering means to construct transactions, query nodes for information and
maintain personal private keys.</li>
</ul>
<p>These three major pieces of software make use of common functionality provided by the following libraries within the Tari
project source code:</p>
<ul>
<li>Local data storage</li>
<li>Cryptography services</li>
<li>Peer-to-peer networking and messaging services</li>
</ul>

<p>Tari Base Nodes form a peer-to-peer network for a proof-of-work based blockchain running the <a href="Glossary.html#mimblewimble">Mimblewimble</a>
protocol. The proof-of-work is performed via merge mining with Monero. Arguments for this design are
presented <a href="RFC-0001_overview.html#proof-of-work">in the overview</a>.</p>
<p>Tari Base Nodes MUST carry out the following tasks:</p>
<ul>
<li>validate all <a href="Glossary.html#tari-coin">Tari coin</a> transactions;</li>
<li>propagate valid <a href="Glossary.html#transaction">transaction</a>s to peer nodes;</li>
<li>validate all new <a href="Glossary.html#block">block</a>s received;</li>
<li>propagate validated new blocks to peer nodes;</li>
<li>connect to peer nodes to catch up (sync) with their blockchain state;</li>
<li>provide historical block information to peers that are syncing.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once the Digital Assets Network (DAN) goes live, Base Nodes will also need to support the tasks described in
<a href="RFC-0300_DAN.html">RFC-0300/Assets</a>. These requirements are omitted for the moment.</p>
<p>To carry out these tasks effectively, Base Nodes SHOULD:</p>
<ul>
<li>save the <a href="Glossary.html#blockchain">blockchain</a> into an indexed local database;</li>
<li>maintain an index of all Unspent Transaction Outputs (<a href="Glossary.html#unspent-transaction-outputs">UTXO</a>s);</li>
<li>maintain a list of all pending, valid transactions that have not yet been mined (the <a href="Glossary.html#mempool">mempool</a>);</li>
<li>manage a list of Base Node peers present on the network.</li>
</ul>
<p>Tari Base Nodes MAY implement chain pruning strategies that are features of Mimblewimble, including transaction
<a href="https://tlu.tarilabs.com/protocols/grin-protocol-overview/MainReport.html#mimblewimble-protocol-overview">cut-through and block compaction techniques</a>.</p>
<p>Tari Base Nodes MAY also implement the following services via an Application Programming Interface (API) to clients:</p>
<ul>
<li>Block queries</li>
<li>Kernel data queries</li>
<li>Transaction queries</li>
<li>Submission of new transactions</li>
</ul>
<p>Such clients may include &quot;light&quot; clients, block explorers, wallets and Tari applications.</p>
<h3 id="transaction-validation-and-propagation"><a class="header" href="#transaction-validation-and-propagation">Transaction Validation and Propagation</a></h3>
<p>Base nodes can be notified of new transactions by:</p>
<ul>
<li>connected peers;</li>
<li>clients via APIs.</li>
</ul>
<p>When a new transaction has been received, it has the <code>unvalidated</code> <a href="Glossary.html#validationstate">ValidationState</a>. The transaction is then passed
to the transaction validation service, where its state will become <code>rejected</code>, <code>timelocked</code> or <code>validated</code>.</p>
<p>The transaction validation service checks that:</p>
<ul>
<li>All inputs to the transaction are valid <a href="Glossary.html#unspent-transaction-outputs">UTXO</a>s.</li>
<li>No inputs are duplicated.</li>
<li>All inputs are able to be spent (they are not time-locked).</li>
<li>All inputs are signed by their owners.</li>
<li>All outputs have valid <a href="Glossary.html#range-proof">range proof</a>s.</li>
<li>No outputs currently exist in the <a href="Glossary.html#unspent-transaction-outputs">UTXO</a> set.</li>
<li>The transaction does not have <a href="RFC-0230_HTLC.html#time-locked-contracts">timelocks</a> applied, limiting it from being mined and added to the blockchain before a
specified block height or timestamp has been reached.</li>
<li>The transaction excess has a valid signature.</li>
<li>The transaction excess is a valid public key. This proves that:
$$ \Sigma \left( \mathrm{inputs} - \mathrm{outputs} - \mathrm{fees} \right) = 0 $$.</li>
</ul>
<p><code>Rejected</code> transactions are dropped silently.</p>
<p><code>Timelocked</code> transactions are:</p>
<ul>
<li>marked with a timelocked status and get added to the <a href="Glossary.html#mempool">mempool</a>;</li>
<li>will be evaluated again at a later state to determine if the timelock has passed and if it can be upgraded to &quot;Validated&quot; status.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> More detailed information is available in the <a href="RFC-0230_HTLC.html#time-locked-contracts">timelocks</a> RFC document.</p>
<p><code>Validated</code> transactions are:</p>
<ul>
<li>added to the <a href="Glossary.html#mempool">mempool</a>;</li>

<h3 id="block-validation-and-propagation"><a class="header" href="#block-validation-and-propagation">Block Validation and Propagation</a></h3>
<p>The block validation and propagation process is analogous to that of transactions. New blocks are received from the 
peer-to-peer network, or from an API call if the Base Node is connected to a Miner.</p>
<p>When a new block is received, it is assigned the <code>unvalidated</code> <a href="Glossary.html#validationstate">ValidationState</a>. The block is then passed to the
block validation service. The validation service checks that:</p>
<ul>
<li>The block has not been processed before.</li>
<li>Every <a href="Glossary.html#transaction">transaction</a> in the block is valid.</li>
<li>The proof-of-work is valid.</li>
<li>The block header is well-formed.</li>
<li>The block is being added to the chain with the highest accumulated proof-of-work.
<ul>
<li>It is possible for the chain to temporarily fork; Base Nodes SHOULD account for forks up to some configured depth.</li>
<li>It is possible that blocks may be received out of order, particularly while syncing. Base Nodes SHOULD keep blocks 
that have block heights greater than the current chain tip in memory for some preconfigured period.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The sum of all excesses is a valid public key. This proves that:
$$ \Sigma \left( \mathrm{inputs} - \mathrm{outputs} - \mathrm{fees} \right) = 0$$. </li>
<li>Check if <a href="RFC-0140_Syncing_and_seeding.html#pruning-and-cut-through">cut-through</a> was applied and, if a block contains already spent outputs, reject that block.</li>
</ul>
<p>Because Mimblewimble blocks can simply be seen as large transactions with multiple inputs and outputs, the block 
validation service checks all transaction verification on the block as well.</p>
<p><code>Rejected</code> blocks are dropped silently.</p>
<p>Base Nodes are not obliged to accept connections from any peer node on the network. In particular:</p>
<ul>
<li>Base Nodes MAY refuse connections from peers that have been added to a denylist.</li>
<li>Base Nodes MAY be configured to exclusively connect to a given set of peer nodes.</li>
</ul>
<p><code>Validated</code> blocks are</p>
<ul>
<li>added to the <a href="Glossary.html#blockchain">blockchain</a>;</li>
<li>forwarded to peers using the block <a href="Glossary.html#broadcaststrategy">BroadcastStrategy</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, when a block has been validated and added to the blockchain:</p>
<ul>
<li>The mempool MUST also remove all transactions that are present in the newly validated block.</li>
<li>The UTXO set MUST be updated by removing all inputs in the block, and adding all the new outputs into it.</li>
</ul>

without notice.</p>
<p>This document may include preliminary concepts that may or may not be in the process of being developed by the Tari

<h2 id="goals-4"><a class="header" href="#goals-4">Goals</a></h2>
<p>The aim of this Request for Comment (RFC) is to describe the high-level Base Node architecture.</p>
<h2 id="architectural-layout"><a class="header" href="#architectural-layout">Architectural Layout</a></h2>
<p>The Base Node architecture is designed to be modular, robust and performant.</p>
<p><img src="theme/images/base_layer_arch.png" alt="Base Layer architecture" /></p>
<p>The major components are separated into separate modules. Each module exposes a public Application Programming Interface
(API), which communicates with other modules using asynchronous messages via futures.</p>
<h3 id="base-node-service"><a class="header" href="#base-node-service">Base Node Service</a></h3>
<p>The Base Node Service is an instantiation of a Tari Comms Service, which subscribes to and handles specific messages
coming from the P2P Tari network via the Comms Module of a live Tari communications node. The Base Node Service's job is
to delegate the jobs required by those messages to its sub-modules, consisting primarily of the Transaction Validation
Service, the Block Validation Service and the Block synchronisation service, using an asynchronous Request-Response
pattern.</p>
<p>The Base Node Service will pass messages back to the P2P network via the Comms Module, based on the results of its
actions.</p>
<p>The primary messages that a Base Node will subscribe to are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>NewTransaction.</strong> A New Transaction is being propagated over the network. If it has not seen the transaction before,
the Base Node will validate the transaction and, if it is valid:</p>
<ul>
<li>add it to its mempool;</li>
<li>pass the transaction on to peers.</li>
</ul>
<p>Otherwise, the transaction is dropped.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>NewBlock.</strong> A newly mined block is being propagated over the network. If the node has not seen the block before, the
node will validate it. Its action depends on the validation outcome:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Invalid block</em> - drop the block.</li>
<li><em>Valid block appending to the longest chain</em> - add the block to the local state; propagate the block to peers.</li>
<li><em>Valid block forking off main chain</em> - add the block to the local state; propagate the block to peers.</li>
<li><em>Valid block building off unknown block</em> - add the orphan block to the local state.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Sync Request.</strong> A peer is synchronizing state and is asking for block data. The node can decide to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ignore or ban the peer (based on previous behaviour heuristics).</li>
<li>Try and provide the data, returning an appropriate response. Note that most nodes can only offer block data up until
their pruning horizon. Only full archival nodes can return the full block history. Refer to
<a href="RFC-0140_Syncing_and_seeding.html">RFC-0140</a> for more details.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The validation procedures are complex and are thus encapsulated in their own sub-services. These services hold
references to the blockchain state API, the mempool API, a range proof service and whatever other modules they need to
complete their work. Each validation module has a single primary method, <code>validate_xxx()</code>, which takes in the
transaction or block to be validated and returns a future that resolves once the validation task is complete.</p>
<h3 id="distributed-hash-table-dht-service"><a class="header" href="#distributed-hash-table-dht-service">Distributed Hash Table (DHT) Service</a></h3>
<p>Peer discovery is a key service that blockchain nodes provide so that the peer mesh network can be navigated by the full
nodes making up the network.</p>
<p>In Tari, the peer-to-peer network is not only used by full nodes (Base Nodes), but also by Validator Nodes, and</p>
<p>Tari and Digital Assets Network (DAN) clients.</p>
<p>For this reason, peer management is handled internally by the Comms layer. If a Base Node wants to propagate a message, 
new block or transaction, for example, it simply selects a <code>BROADCAST</code> strategy for the message and the Comms layer
will do the rest.</p>
<p>When a node wishes to query a peer for its peer list, this request will be handled by the <code>DHTService</code>. It will
communicate with its Comms module's Peer Manager, and provide that information to the peer.</p>
<h3 id="blockchain-state-module"><a class="header" href="#blockchain-state-module">Blockchain State Module</a></h3>
<p>The blockchain state module is responsible for providing a persistent storage solution for blockchain state data. For
Tari, this is delivered using the Lightning Memory-mapped Database (LMDB). LMDB is highly performant, intelligent and
straightforward to use. An LMDB is essentially treated as a hash map data structure that transparently handles
memory caching, disk Input/Output (I/O) and multi-threaded access.</p>
<p>The blockchain module is able to run as a standalone service, but must be thread-safe. Block and transaction validation
requests are futures-based. These are asynchronous requests, which means that multiple validation requests can and
should be handled in parallel, in separate threads. Initially, all the logic for a single block or transaction
validation can be executed in sequence, wrapped inside a single future. However, there is scope to optimise this in
future; for example: Validating a block entails checking the proof-of-work (very slow), checking signatures (fast, but
many of them), and checking the accounting (slow). Each of these sub-tasks could also be spun off as a future, with a
master future co-ordinating the sub-futures and assembling the final results.</p>
<p>Tokio is becoming the <em>de facto</em> standard for asynchronous programming in Rust.</p>
<p>Tokio's default task executor provides multi-threaded work-stealing work queues and CPU-bound worker threads out of the
box. This is a good fit for the type of work that base nodes must perform. In addition, the
<a href="https://github.com/tower-rs">Tower project</a> provides a set of traits and middleware that will be very useful in Tari
services, and so it is recommended to follow the Services pattern as used by that project.</p>
<p>This RFC proposes that the 0.1 version of tokio is used in the Tari project until the standard
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/future/index.html">futures</a> library has stabilised before making a switch.</p>
<h3 id="mempool-module"><a class="header" href="#mempool-module">Mempool Module</a></h3>
<p>The mempool module tracks (valid) transactions that the node knows about, but that have not yet been included in a
block. The mempool is ephemeral and non-consensus critical, and as such may be a memory-only data structure. Maintaining
a large mempool is far more important for Base Nodes serving miners than those serving wallets. A mempool will slowly
rebuild after a node reboots.</p>
<p>That said, the mempool module must be thread safe. The Tari mempool module handles requests in the same way as the
Blockchain state module: via futures. The mempool structure itself is a set of hash maps as described in <a href="RFC-0190_Mempool.html">RFC-0190</a>. For
performance reasons, it may be worthwhile using a <a href="https://crates.io/crates/chashmap">concurrent hash map</a> implementation.</p>
<h3 id="grpc-interface"><a class="header" href="#grpc-interface">gRPC Interface</a></h3>
<p>Base Nodes need to provide a local communication interface in addition to the P2P communication interface. This is
best achieved using <a href="https://grpc.io/">gRPC</a>. The Base Node gRPC interface provides access to the public API methods of the Base Node
Service, the mempool module and the blockchain state module, as discussed above.</p>
<p>gRPC access is useful for tools such as local User Interfaces (UIs) to a running Base Node; client wallets running on
the same machine as the Base Node that want a more direct communication interface to the node than the P2P network
provides; third-party applications such as block explorers; and, of course, miners.</p>
<p>A non-exhaustive list of methods the base node module API will expose includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Blockchain state calls, including:
<ul>
<li>checking whether a given Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) is in the current UTXO set;</li>
<li>requesting the latest block height;</li>
<li>requesting the total accumulated work on the longest chain;</li>
<li>requesting a specific block at a given height;</li>
<li>requesting the Merklish root commitment of the current UTXO set;</li>
<li>requesting a block header for a given height;</li>
<li>requesting the block header for the chain tip;</li>
<li>validating signatures for a given transaction kernel;</li>
<li>validating a new block without adding it to the state tree;</li>
<li>validating and adding a (validated) new block to the state, and informing of the result (orphaned, fork, reorg, etc.).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Mempool calls
<ul>
<li>The number of unconfirmed transactions</li>
<li>The number of orphaned transactions</li>
<li>Returning a list of transaction ranked by some criterion (of interest to miners)</li>
<li>The current size of the mempool (in transaction weight)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Block and transaction validation calls</li>
<li>Block synchronisation calls</li>

<h2 id="description-5"><a class="header" href="#description-5">Description</a></h2>
<p>The following proposal draws from many of the key points of debate from the Tari community on the topic of Tari’s
main chain proof of work strategy. The early working assumption was that Tari would be 100% merged mined by Monero.</p>
<p>It would be nice to have a single, merge mined Proof of Work (PoW) algorithm, but the risks of hash rate attacks are real and
meaningful. Double-spends and altering history can happen with &gt;50% hash power, while selfish mining and eclipse
attacks can happen with &gt;33% hash power for a poorly connected attacker and &gt;25% for a well-connected attacker (see
<a href="http://repositum.tuwien.ac.at/obvutwhs/download/pdf/2315652"><em>Merged Mining: Analysis of Effects and Implications</em></a>).
Any non-merge mined PoW algorithm that is currently employed is even more vulnerable, especially if one can simply buy
hash rate on platforms like NiceHash.</p>
<p>Hybrid mining is a strategy that apportions blocks across multiple PoW algorithms. If the hybrid algorithms are
independent, then one can get at most x% of the total hash rate, where x is the fraction of blocks apportioned to that
algorithm. As a result, the threat of a double-spend or selfish mining attack is mitigated, and in some cases
eliminated.</p>
<p>This proposal puts forward Hybrid mining as the Tari PoW algorithm. However, some details still needed to be decided:</p>
<ul>
<li>the number of algorithms;</li>
<li>the choice of algorithms;</li>
<li>the block distribution;</li>
<li>the difficulty adjustment strategy.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-number-of-algorithms"><a class="header" href="#the-number-of-algorithms">The number of algorithms</a></h3>
<p>In hybrid mining, &quot;independence&quot; of algorithms is key. If the same mining hardware can be used on multiple PoW
algorithms in the hybrid mining scheme, you may as well not bother with hybrid mining, because miners can simply
switch between them.</p>
<p>In practice, no set of algorithms are truly independent. The best we can do is try and choose algorithms that work best
on CPUs, GPUs, and ASICs. In truth, the distinction between GPUs and ASICs is only a matter of time. Any &quot;GPU-friendly&quot;
algorithm is ASIC-friendly too; it's just a case of whether the capital outlay for fabricating them is worth it; and
this will eventually become true for any algorithm that supplies PoW for a growing market cap. Employing merged mining
with major players that use independent hardware introduces another degree of freedom, as long as those are independent,
like RandomX with Monero, SHA-256 with Bitcoin and Scrypt with Litecoin.</p>
<p><em><strong>Note:</strong> Merge mining does not add security per se, but it does add plenty of hash rate and continuity of the blockchain.</em></p>
<p>So really the answer to how many algorithms is: More than one, as independent as possible.</p>
<h3 id="the-choice-of-algorithms"><a class="header" href="#the-choice-of-algorithms">The choice of algorithms</a></h3>
<p>A good technical choice would be merge mining with Monero, Bitcoin and Litecoin, if enough interest could be
attracted from those mining communities. However, that would rule out any participation from Tari supporters and
enthusiasts, at least in the early stages. So, to be inclusive of Tari supporters and enthusiasts, merge mining RandomX
with Monero and another GPU/ASIC-friendly algorithm, like SHA3, is proposed. For the independent miners, the proposal
settled on a SHA3-based algorithm, being GPU/ASIC-friendly as well. Since no major coin uses SHA3, it's not currently
available on NiceHash, and because it's such a simple algorithm, it stands a good chance of being &quot;commoditized&quot; when
ASICs are eventually manufactured. Meaning, SHA3 ASICs will be widely available and not available from only a single
supplier.</p>
<p><em><strong>Edit:</strong> Handshake, which launched a few months ago, selected a Hashcash PoW algorithm
<a href="https://handshake.org/files/handshake.txt">(see #Consensus)</a> using SHA3 and Blake2B for many of the same reasons:
SHA3 is currently under-represented in PoW; SHA3 usage in combination with Blake2B in PoW creates a more level playing
field for hardware manufacturers.</em></p>
<h3 id="the-block-distribution"><a class="header" href="#the-block-distribution">The block distribution</a></h3>
<p>To reduce the chance of hash rate attacks, an even 50/50 distribution is needed, as discussed earlier. However,
sufficient buy-in is needed, especially with regards to merge mining RandomX with Monero. To make it worthwhile for a
Monero pool operator to merge mine Tari, but still guard against hash rate attacks and to be inclusive of independent
Tari supporters and enthusiasts, a 60/40 split is proposed in favour of merge mining RandomX with Monero. The
approaching <a href="https://web.getmonero.org/resources/moneropedia/tail-emission.html">Monero tail emission</a> at the end of May
2022 should also make this a worthwhile proposal for Monero pool operators.</p>
<h3 id="the-difficulty-adjustment-strategy"><a class="header" href="#the-difficulty-adjustment-strategy">The difficulty adjustment strategy</a></h3>
<p>The choice of difficulty adjustment algorithm is important. In typical hybrid mining strategies, each algorithm operates
completely independently with a scaled-up target block time and is the most likely approach that any blockchain will
take. Tari testnet has been running very successfully on Linear Weighted Moving Average (LWMA) from Bitcoin &amp; Zcash
Clones <a href="https://github.com/zawy12/difficulty-algorithms/issues/3#issuecomment-442129791">version 2018-11-27</a>. This LWMA
difficulty adjustment algorithm has also been
<a href="https://github.com/tari-labs/modelling/tree/master/scenarios/multi_pow_01">tested in simulations</a> and it proved to be a
good choice in the multi-PoW scene as well.</p>
<h3 id="final-proposal-hybrid-mining-details"><a class="header" href="#final-proposal-hybrid-mining-details">Final proposal, hybrid mining details</a></h3>
<p>The final proposal is summarized below:</p>
<ul>
<li>2x mining algorithms, with average combined target block time at 120 s, to match Monero's block interval</li>
<li>LWMA version 2018-11-27 difficulty algorithm adjustment for both with difficulty algo window of 90 blocks</li>
<li>Algorithm 1: Monero merged mining
<ul>
<li>at ~60% blocks distribution, based on block time setting of 192.0</li>
<li>using RandomX, with <code>seed_hash</code> as arbitrary data, re-use restricted by age measured in Tari blocks</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Algorithm 2: Independent mining
<ul>
<li>at ~40% blocks distribution, based on block time setting of 288.0 s</li>
<li>SHA3-based algorithm, details to be fleshed out</li>

<p>The aim of this Request for Comment (RFC) is to describe the syncing, seeding, pruning and cut-through process.</p>

<h3 id="syncing"><a class="header" href="#syncing">Syncing</a></h3>
<p>When a new node comes online, loses connection or encounters a chain reorganization that is longer than it can tolerate, 
it must enter syncing mode. This will allow it to recover its state to the newest up-to-date state. Syncing can be 
divided into two <a href="Glossary.html#synchronisationstrategy">SynchronizationStrategy</a>s: complete sync and sync. Complete sync means that the node communicates with 
an archive node to get the complete history of every single block from genesis block. Sync involves the node getting 
every block from its <a href="Glossary.html#pruning-horizon">pruning horizon</a> to <a href="Glossary.html#current-head">current head</a>, as well as every block header 
from genesis block. </p>
<h4 id="complete-sync"><a class="header" href="#complete-sync">Complete Sync</a></h4>
<p>Complete sync is only available from archive nodes, as these will be the only nodes that will be able to supply the 
complete history required to sync every block with every transaction from genesis block up onto <a href="Glossary.html#current-head">current head</a>. </p>
<h4 id="syncing-process"><a class="header" href="#syncing-process">Syncing Process</a></h4>
<p>The syncing process MUST be done in the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Set <a href="Glossary.html#synchronisationstate">SynchronizationState</a> to <code>Synchronizing</code>.</li>
<li>Ask peers for their latest block, so it can get the total Proof-of-Work (PoW). </li>
<li>Choose the longest chain based on total PoW done on that chain.</li>
<li>Select a connected peer with the longest chain to sync from. This is based on the following criteria:
<ul>
<li>Does the peer have a high enough <a href="Glossary.html#pruning-horizon">pruning horizon</a>?</li>
<li>Does the peer allow syncing?</li>
<li>Does the peer have a low latency?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Download all headers from genesis block up onto <a href="Glossary.html#current-head">current head</a>, and validate the headers as you receive them.</li>
<li>Download Unspent Transaction Output (<a href="Glossary.html#unspent-transaction-outputs">UTXO</a>) set at <a href="Glossary.html#pruning-horizon">pruning horizon</a>. </li>
<li>Download all blocks from <a href="Glossary.html#pruning-horizon">pruning horizon</a> up to <a href="Glossary.html#current-head">current head</a>. If the node is doing a 
complete sync, the <a href="Glossary.html#pruning-horizon">pruning horizon</a> will be infinite, which means you will download all blocks ever 
created.</li>
<li>Validate blocks as if they were just mined and then received, in chronological order. </li>
</ol>
<p>After this process, the node will be in sync, and will be able to process blocks and transactions normally. </p>
<h4 id="keeping-in-sync"><a class="header" href="#keeping-in-sync">Keeping in Sync</a></h4>
<p>The node SHOULD periodically test its peers with ping messages to ensure that they are alive. When a node sends a ping 
message, it MUST include the current total PoW, hash of the <a href="Glossary.html#current-head">current head</a> and genesis block hash of its 
own current longest chain in the ping message. The receiving node MUST reply with a pong message, also including the total 
PoW, <a href="Glossary.html#current-head">current head</a> and genesis block hash of its longest chain. If the two chains do not match up, the node 
with the lowest PoW is responsible for asking the peer for syncing information and set <a href="Glossary.html#synchronisationstate">SynchronizationState</a> to <code>Synchronizing</code>. </p>
<p>If the genesis block hashes do not match, the node is removed from its peer list, as this node is running a different 
blockchain. </p>
<p>This will be handled by the node asking for each block header from the <a href="Glossary.html#current-head">current head</a>, going backward for 
older blocks, until a known block is found. If a known block is found, and if it has missing blocks, it MUST set 
<a href="Glossary.html#synchronisationstate">SynchronizationState</a> to <code>Synchronizing</code> while it is busy catching up those blocks.</p>
<p>If no block is found, the node will enter sync mode and resync. It cannot recover from its state, as the fork is older 
than its <a href="Glossary.html#pruning-horizon">pruning horizon</a>.</p>
<h4 id="chain-forks"><a class="header" href="#chain-forks">Chain Forks</a></h4>
<p>Chain forks can be a problem, since in Mimblewimble not all nodes keep the complete transaction history. The design 
philosophy is more along the lines of only keeping the current [Blockchain state]. However, if such a 
node only maintains the current [Blockchain state], it is not possible for the node to &quot;rewind&quot; its 
state to handle forks in the chain history. In this case, a mode must resync its chain to recover the necessary 
transaction history up onto its <a href="Glossary.html#pruning-horizon">pruning horizon</a>.</p>
<p>To counter this problem, we use <a href="Glossary.html#pruning-horizon">pruning horizon</a>. This allows every node (<a href="Glossary.html#base-node">Base Node</a>) to be a &quot;light&quot; 
<a href="archivenode">archival node</a>. This in effect means that the node will keep a full history for a short while. If the node 
encounters a fork, it can easily rewind its state to apply the fork. If the fork is longer than the <a href="Glossary.html#pruning-horizon">pruning horizon</a>, 
the node will enter a sync state, where it will resync. </p>
<h3 id="pruning-and-cut-through"><a class="header" href="#pruning-and-cut-through">Pruning and Cut-through</a></h3>
<p>In Mimblewimble, the state can be completely verified using the current <a href="Glossary.html#unspent-transaction-outputs">UTXO</a> set 
(which contains the output commitments and range proofs), the set of excess signatures (contained in the transaction kernels) 
and the PoW. The full block and transaction history is not required. This allows base layer nodes to remove old used 
inputs from the <a href="Glossary.html#blockchain">blockchain</a> and or the <a href="Glossary.html#mempool">mempool</a>. <a href="RFC-0110_BaseNodes.html#Pruning-and-cut-through">Cut-through</a> happens in the <a href="Glossary.html#mempool">mempool</a> while pruning 
happens in the <a href="Glossary.html#blockchain">blockchain</a> with already confirmed transactions. This will remove the spent inputs and outputs, but will 
retain the excesses of each <a href="Glossary.html#transaction">transaction</a>. </p>
<p>Pruning is only for the benefit of the local Base Node, as it reduces the local blockchain size. Pruning only happens 
after the block is older than the <a href="Glossary.html#pruning-horizon">pruning horizon</a> height. A Base Node will either run in archive mode 
or prune mode. If the Base Node is running in archive mode, it MUST NOT prune. </p>
<p>When running in pruning mode, <a href="Glossary.html#base-node">Base Node</a>s MUST remove all spent outputs that are older than the 
<a href="Glossary.html#pruning-horizon">pruning horizon</a>in their current stored <a href="Glossary.html#unspent-transaction-outputs">UTXO</a> when a new block is received from another <a href="Glossary.html#base-node">Base Node</a>.</p>

<p>This Request for Comment (RFC) describes the transaction protocol for peer-to-peer Tari payments using 
the Mimblewimble protocol. It also considers some attacks that may be launched against the protocol and offers some 
discussion around those attacks and potential alternatives to the protocol.</p>
<p>The goal is to describe a transaction protocol that:</p>
<ul>
<li>permits multiple recipients;</li>
<li>preserves privacy regarding how many parties are involved in the transaction; and</li>
<li>is secure against all reasonable attacks.</li>
</ul>

</ul>
<h2 id="description-7"><a class="header" href="#description-7">Description</a></h2>
<p>The Tari base layer is built using <a href="https://tlu.tarilabs.com/protocols/grin-protocol-overview/MainReport.html" title="Mimblewimble on TLU">Mimblewimble</a>, which requires that all parties involved in a Tari transfer must interact
to construct a valid <a href="https://tlu.tarilabs.com/protocols/mimblewimble-1/MainReport.html" title="Mimblewimble
transactions on TLU">Mimblewimble transaction</a>.</p>
<p>A valid transaction involves:</p>
<ul>
<li>a set of one or more inputs being spent by the Sender;</li>
<li>a set of zero or more outputs being sent to the Sender;</li>
<li>a set of recipients, each of whom MUST construct exactly one output; and</li>
<li>a set of partial Schnorr signatures which, when aggregated, validates the transaction construction and indicates every
party's satisfaction with the terms.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-issue-with-multiple-recipients"><a class="header" href="#the-issue-with-multiple-recipients">The Issue with Multiple Recipients</a></h3>
<p>Each party involved in a Tari transaction must produce a partial signature, signing the same challenge. This challenge is
defined as</p>
<p>$$ e = H(\Sigma R_i \Vert \Sigma P_i \Vert m) $$</p>
<p>where \(R_i\) are public nonces generated by each party for this signature; \(P_i\) are the public <a href="Glossary.html#spending-key">Spending Key</a>s;
and <em>m</em> is the additional metadata for the transaction. \(\Sigma P_i\) is the value of the (pre-offset) excess that is
stored in the transaction kernel.</p>
<p>Notice that every signing party needs to know the sum of all the nonces and public spending keys. This suggests that
every party knows how many parties are involved in the transaction, which is not an ideal privacy scenario. It would be
preferable if a secure scheme could be found where each recipient interacts only with the sender and does not need to
calculate these sums themselves.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, as discussed below, it seems that using any known scheme, it's not possible to satisfy this
privacy goal while achieving the desired security level.</p>
<h3 id="the-issue-with-multiple-senders"><a class="header" href="#the-issue-with-multiple-senders">The Issue with Multiple Senders</a></h3>
<p>To increase privacy, the public excess values are <a href="https://github.com/mimblewimble/grin/blob/master/doc/intro.md#kernel-offsets">offset</a> by a constant random value. The choice of this value, as well
as fee selection, can only be set once per transaction. The privilege of selecting these values is generally bestowed on
the sender, since the sender pays the fee. Allowing multiple sending parties (or equivalently, allowing recipients to provide
inputs) would require a negotiation round to set the fee and offset before the transaction could be constructed. This is
a complication we don't want to deal with, and so all schemes presented here allow exactly one sender.</p>
<h3 id="two-party-transactions"><a class="header" href="#two-party-transactions">Two-party Transactions</a></h3>
<p>Two-party transactions are fairly straightforward and are described in detail by Tari Labs University (TLU). (Refer to 
<a href="https://tlu.tarilabs.com/protocols/mimblewimble-1/MainReport.html" title="Mimblewimble
transactions on TLU">Mimblewimble Transaction</a>.)</p>
<p>It is proposed that Tari implement this single-round two-party transaction scheme as a special case to support both online
two-party transactions as well as &quot;offline&quot; transactions such as via email, text message and carrier pigeon.</p>

<h2 id="transaction-id"><a class="header" href="#transaction-id">Transaction ID</a></h2>
<p>The scheme above makes use of a <code>tx_id</code> field in every peer-to-peer message. Since all messages are stateless and
asynchronous, peers need some way of figuring out which message refers to which transaction. The transaction ID fulfils
this role.</p>
<p>The ID does not appear on the blockchain in any manner; is purely used to disambiguate Tari transaction messages and
can be discarded after the transaction is broadcast to the network.</p>
<p>The <code>tx_id</code> is unique for every receiver so that any observers of the communication will not be able to group receivers
together (however, the communication should be over secure channels in general).</p>
<p>The format of the transaction ID is a four-byte, little-endian integer (u64) and is
calculated as</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">H(Rs||i)[0..4]
</code></pre>
<p>where <code>i</code> is the i-th recipient in the transaction. The sender can use the <code>tx_id</code> as a hash map key to identify and
differentiate recipients.</p>
<h2 id="replay-attacks"><a class="header" href="#replay-attacks">Replay Attacks</a></h2>
<p>If any party can be convinced to sign a different message with the same nonce, its private keys will be lost. One way
of achieving this would be if a virtual machine could be &quot;snapshotted&quot; or otherwise cloned at any point between sharing
the public nonce and signing the message. Both copies of the victim's machine will now continue, unaware that there's a
copy participating in a signature round. What then happens is:</p>
<p>$$
\begin{align}
&amp;\text{Clone A} &amp; &amp;\text{Clone B} \\
e_1 &amp;= H(r_1 \Vert r_s \Vert \dots) &amp; e_2 &amp;= H(r_1 \Vert r_s^* \Vert \dots) \\
s_1 &amp;= r_1 + e_1 \cdot k_1 &amp; s_2 &amp;= r_1 + e_2 \cdot k_1 \\
\end{align}
$$</p>
<p>The attacker receives both signatures and trivially calculates the secret key:</p>
<p>$$
\begin{align}
\Delta s &amp;= s_1 - s_2 \\
&amp;= k_1(e_1 - e_2) = k_1\Delta e \\
\Rightarrow k_1 &amp;= \frac{\Delta s}{\Delta e}
\end{align}
$$</p>
<p>We've demonstrated this with the attacker changing their nonce, but literally any alteration to the challenge will provide
a new challenge \(e_2\), enabling the attack.</p>
<p>What can we do about this? In fact, it's not possible to eliminate this attack at all! The reason sits with the proof
that the Schnorr scheme works as a zero-knowledge protocol; the demonstration of this proof is precisely the attack
we're trying to avoid [<a href="https://medium.com/magicofc/interactive-proofs-and-zero-knowledge-b32f6c8d66c3" title="On Interactive Proofs and
Zero-Knowledge: A Primer [Section 3]">GOL19</a>]. If we could eliminate this attack, we'd need to come up with a completely different way
of proving the zero-knowledge property.</p>
<p>So we can't stop it, but we can make it as tricky as possible for the attacker to trick the receiver into replaying the
signature. MuSig does this by requiring parties to share the hash of their nonces beforehand. At its extreme: in the
two-party, single-round scheme, for example, the attacker would need to be able to control the victim's machine code
execution (like running a debugger), at which point one might think the attacker could read the private key directly
from memory anyway.</p>
<h2 id="rogue-key-attacks"><a class="header" href="#rogue-key-attacks">Rogue Key Attacks</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://tlu.tarilabs.com/cryptography/digital_signatures/introduction_schnorr_signatures.html#key-cancellation-attack">Rogue Key attacks</a>
are another type of attack that can occur in multi-signature schemes.</p>
<p>In this case, the attacker has the freedom to choose a key or nonce <em>after</em> the victim has already disclosed theirs. This
may allow the attacker to forge a valid signature on behalf of the victim. A recent paper, [<a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/417.pdf" title="On the Security of Two-Round Multi-Signatures">DRI19</a>], suggests that
<em>any</em> Schnorr-based, two-round multi-signature scheme is vulnerable to a rogue key attack.</p>
<p>How this might apply in an insecure two-round Tari multi-signature scheme is as follows: A receiver sends their public
nonce; output commitment and range proof; and public spending key to the sender, but then decides to cancel the
transaction by refusing to provide a signature and sending an &quot;Abort&quot; message to the sender instead. The sender could,
if they wanted, forge the 2-of-2 signature using this rogue key attack and broadcast the transaction anyway.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> This attack is not applicable in the one-round, two-party scheme, since the receiver returns their information in an
all-or-nothing manner. However, the <em>receiver</em> could attempt to forge a signature, since they have the Sender's public
nonce, but there's nothing they can really do with this signature; they certainly cannot broadcast a transaction with it
because they don't have any of the transaction data at this stage.</p>
<p>We avoid rogue-key attacks in the Tari multi-recipient scheme by employing three rounds. In the first round, parties share a
hash of their public nonces, which each party can later use to verify that no nonces were changed after the actual
public nonces were shared.</p>

<p>This document describes the specification for Emoji Ids. Emoji Ids are encoded node ids used for humans to easily verify

<p>Tari <a href="Glossary.html#communication-node">Communication Node</a>s are identified on the network via their <a href="Glossary.html#node-id">Node ID</a>; which in turn are derived from the node's
public key. Both the node id and public key are simple large integer numbers.</p>
<p>The most common practice for human beings to copy large numbers in cryptocurrency software is to scan a QR code or copy
and paste a value from one application to another. These numbers are typically encoded using hexadecimal or Base58
encoding. The user will then typically scan (parts) of the string by eye to ensure that the value was transferred
correctly.</p>
<p>For Tari, we propose encoding values, the node ID in particular, using emoji. The advantages of this approach are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Emoji are more easily identifiable; and if selected carefully, less prone to identification errors (e.g. mistaking an
O for a 0).</li>
<li>The alphabet can be considerably larger than hexadecimal (16) or Base58 (58), resulting in shorter character sequences
in the encoding.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-specification"><a class="header" href="#the-specification">The specification</a></h3>
<h4 id="the-emoji-character-map"><a class="header" href="#the-emoji-character-map">The emoji character map</a></h4>
<p>An emoji alphabet of 1,024 characters is selected. Each emoji is assigned a unique index from 0 to 1023 inclusive. This
list is the emoji map. For example,</p>
<ul>
<li>😀 =&gt; 0</li>
<li>😘 =&gt; 1</li>
<li>...</li>
<li>🦊 =&gt; 1023</li>
</ul>
<p>The emoji SHOULD be selected such that</p>
<ul>
<li>Similar looking emoji are excluded from the map. e.g. Neither 😁 or 😄 should be included. Similarly the Irish and
Côte d'Ivoirean flags look very similar, and both should be excluded.</li>
<li>Modified emoji (skin tones, gender modifiers) are excluded. Only the &quot;base&quot; emoji is considered.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="encoding"><a class="header" href="#encoding">Encoding</a></h4>
<p>The essential strategy in the encoding process is to map a sequence of 8-bit values onto a 10-bit alphabet. The general
encoding procedure is as follows:</p>
<p>Given a large integer value, represented as a <em>byte array</em>, <code>S</code>, in little-endian format (most significant digit last).
Assume the string is addressable, i.e. <code>S[i]</code> is the <code>i</code>th byte in the array.</p>
<ul>
<li>Set <code>CURSOR</code> to 0, Set <code>L</code> to a multiple of 10 that is <code>&lt;= len(S)</code>.</li>
<li>Set <code>IDX</code> to <code>[]</code> (an empty array)</li>
<li>While <code>CURSOR &lt; L</code>:
<ul>
<li>Set <code>L &lt;= S[CURSOR/8 + 1]</code>, the current low byte; if the index would overflow, set <code>L</code> to zero.</li>
<li>Set <code>H &lt;= S[CURSOR/8]</code>, the current high byte</li>
<li>Set <code>n &lt;= CURSOR % 8</code>, the position of the cursor in the current high byte</li>
<li>Set <code>i &lt;= ((H as u8) &lt;&lt; n) &lt;&lt; 2 + (L &gt;&gt; (6 - n))</code>, where the first shift left (<code>H as u8 &lt;&lt;n</code>) is on a one-byte width
(effectively losing the first n bits) and the second shift left is on a 8-byte width (u64).</li>
<li>Push <code>i</code> onto <code>IDX</code></li>
<li><code>CURSOR &lt;= CURSOR + 10</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Return <code>IDX</code></li>
</ul>
<p>The emoji string is created by mapping the <code>IDX</code> array to the emoji map.</p>
<h4 id="emoji-id-definition"><a class="header" href="#emoji-id-definition">Emoji ID definition</a></h4>
<p>The emoji ID is an emoji string of 12 characters. Each character encodes 10 bits according to the bitmap:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">+---------------------+------------------+-------------------+
|  Node Id (104 bits) | Version (6 bits) | Checksum (10 bits)|
+---------------------+------------------+-------------------+
</code></pre>
<p>The emoji ID is calculated from a 104-bit node id represented as 13 bytes (<code>B</code>) as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Take the current emoji ID version number, <code>v</code> and add <code>v &lt;&lt; 2</code> as an additional byte to <code>B</code>. This &quot;right-pads&quot; the
version in the last byte. This is necessary since we have a 14 byte (112 bit) sequence, which is not divisible by 10.
This padding sets the last 2 bits, which will be discarded, to zero.</li>
<li>Encode B into an emoji string with <code>L</code> = 11.</li>
<li>Calculate a 12th emoji using the Luhn mod 1024 checksum algorithm.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="decoding"><a class="header" href="#decoding">Decoding</a></h4>
<p>One can extract the node id from an emoji ID as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Calculate the checksum of the first 11 emoji using the Luhn mod 1024 algorithm. If it does not match the 12th emoji,
return with an error. if any emoji character is not in the emoji map, return an error.</li>
<li>Extract the version number:
<ol start="3">
<li>Do a reverse lookup of emoji<code>[10]</code> to find its index. Store this u64 value in <code>I</code>.</li>
<li>The Version number is <code>(I &amp;&amp; 0x3F) &gt;&gt; 2</code>. This can be used to set the Emoji map accordingly (and may have to be
done iteratively, since the version is encoded into the emoji string).</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Set <code>CURSOR = 0</code>.</li>
<li>Set <code>B = []</code>, and empty byte array</li>
<li>While <code>CURSOR &lt;= 11</code>:
<ol start="4">
<li>Set <code>k &lt;= CURSOR * 2</code></li>
<li>Do a reverse lookup of the emoji<code>[CURSOR]</code> to find its index. Store this u64 value in <code>L</code>.</li>
<li>If <code>k &gt; 0</code>, set <code>H</code> to the reverse lookup index of emoji<code>[CURSOR-1]</code> as u8 (first 2 bits are discarded), else
<code>H=0</code>.</li>
<li>Set <code>v = ((H as u8)  &lt;&lt; (8-k)) + (L &gt;&gt; (2+k))</code>. Push v onto tho <code>B</code>.</li>
<li>Set <code>CURSOR &lt;= CURSOR + 1</code></li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If the algorithm completes, <code>B</code> holds the node ID.</p>
<h4 id="versioning"><a class="header" href="#versioning">Versioning</a></h4>
<p>The current emoji ID version number is 1. If the emoji alphabet changes, the version number MUST be incremented. This
will usually cause incompatible versions of the emoji ID to be detected. However, this is not fail-safe.</p>
<p>The last 6 bits of the 11th emoji encodes the version; this means that the first 4 bits are part of the node ID. On a
reverse mapping, there is a chance that the reverse mapping would offer a valid, but incorrect version number if the new
mapping are not chosen carefully.</p>
<h5 id="example"><a class="header" href="#example">Example.</a></h5>
<p>In version 1, 😘 =&gt; <code>0b0000_000001</code> = 1 in the map. Seeing 😘 as the 11th emoji in a string would result in a version
code of 1, which is consistent and expected.</p>
<p>However, in unlucky version 13, if 😘 moves in the map to number 13 (<code>0b0000_001101</code>), the version decoding would also
be valid and thus we wouldn't be able to unambiguously identify the version.</p>

<li>A <a href="Glossary.html#validator-node">Validator Node</a> is able to derive a <a href="Glossary.html#node-id">node ID</a> from the Validator Node registration transaction on the Base Layer.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="abstract-1"><a class="header" href="#abstract-1">Abstract</a></h3>
<p>The backbone of the Tari communication network consists of a large number of nodes that maintain peer connections between each other.
These nodes forward and propagate encrypted and unencrypted data messages through the network such as joining requests, discovery requests, <a href="Glossary.html#transaction">transaction</a>s and completed <a href="Glossary.html#block">block</a>s.
Network clients, not responsible for maintaining the network, are able to create ad hoc connections with nodes on the network to perform joining and discovery requests.
The majority of communication between clients and nodes will be performed using direct Peer-to-peer (P2P) communication once the discovery process was used to obtain the online communication addresses of peers.
Where possible the efficient Kademlia based directed forwarding of encrypted data messages can be used to perform quick node discovery and joining of clients and nodes on the Tari communication network. 
Where messages are of importance to a wide variety of entities on the network, Gossip protocol based message propagation can be performed to distribute the message to the entire network.</p>
<h3 id="overview"><a class="header" href="#overview">Overview</a></h3>
<p>The Tari communication network is a variant of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kademlia">Kademlia</a> network that allows for fast discovery of nodes, with an added ability to perform Gossip protocol based broadcasting of data messages to the entire network.
The majority of the communication required on the <a href="Glossary.html#base-layer">Base Layer</a> and <a href="Glossary.html#digital-asset-network">Digital Asset Network</a> (DAN) will be performed via direct P2P communication between known clients and nodes.
Alternatively, the Tari communication network can be used for broadcasting joining requests, discovery requests and propagating data messages such as completed blocks, transactions and data messages that are of interest to a large part of the Tari communication network. </p>
<p>The Tari communication network consists of a number of different entities that need to communicate in a distributed and ad-hoc manner. 
The primary entities that need to communicate are Validator Nodes (VN), <a href="Glossary.html#base-node">Base Node</a>s (BN), <a href="Glossary.html#wallet">Wallet</a>s (W) and <a href="Glossary.html#token-wallet">Token Wallet</a>s (TW).
Here are some examples of different communication tasks that need to be performed by these entities on the Tari Communication network:</p>
<ul>
<li>Base Nodes on the Base Layer need to propagate completed blocks and transactions to other Base Nodes using Gossip protocol based broadcasting.</li>
<li>Validator Nodes need to efficiently discover other Validator Nodes in the process of forming Validator Node committees. </li>
<li>Wallets need to communicate and negotiate with other Wallets to create transactions. They also need the ability to submit transactions to the <a href="Glossary.html#mempool">mempool</a> of Base Nodes.</li>
<li>Token Wallets need to communicate with Validator Node <a href="Glossary.html#committee">committee</a>s and other Token Wallets to construct and send DAN instructions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is an overview communication matrix that show which source entities SHOULD initiate communication with destination entities on the Tari Communication network:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th>        \Destination<br>Source</th><th>Validator Node</th><th>Base Node</th><th>Wallet</th><th>Token Wallet</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>Validator Node</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td></tr>
<tr><td>Base Node</td><td>No</td><td>Yes</td><td>No</td><td>No</td></tr>
<tr><td>Wallet</td><td>No</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>No</td></tr>
<tr><td>Token Wallet</td><td>Yes</td><td>No</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<h4 id="communication-nodes-and-communication-clients"><a class="header" href="#communication-nodes-and-communication-clients">Communication Nodes and Communication Clients</a></h4>
<p>To simplify the description of the Tari communication network, the different entities with similar behaviour were grouped into two groups: Communication Nodes and Communication Clients.
Validator Nodes and Base Nodes are Communication Nodes (CN).
Wallets and Token Wallets are Communication Clients (CC).
CNs form the core communication infrastructure of the Tari communication network and are responsible for maintaining the Tari communication network by receiving, forwarding and distributing joining requests, discovery requests, data messages and routing information.
CCs are different from CNs in that they do not maintain the network and they are not responsible for propagating any joining requests, discovery requests, data messages and routing information.
They do make use of the network to submit their own joining requests and perform discovery request of other specific CNs and CCs when they need to communicate with them.
Once a CC has discovered the CC or CN they want to communicate with, they will establish a direct P2P channel with them.
The Tari communication network is unaware of this direct P2P communication once discovery is completed.</p>
<p>The different entity types MUST be grouped into the different communication node types as follows:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th>Entity Type</th><th>Communication Node Type</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>Validator Node</td><td>Communication Node</td></tr>
<tr><td>Base Node</td><td>Communication Node</td></tr>
<tr><td>Wallet</td><td>Communication Client</td></tr>
<tr><td>Token Wallet</td><td>Communication Client</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<h4 id="unique-identification-of-communication-nodes-and-communication-clients"><a class="header" href="#unique-identification-of-communication-nodes-and-communication-clients">Unique identification of Communication Nodes and Communication Clients</a></h4>
<p>In the Tari communication network, each CN or CC makes use of a node ID to determine their position in the network.
This node ID is either assigned based on registration on the Base Layer or can be derived from the CNs or CCs identification public key.
The method used to obtain a node ID will either enhance or limit the trustworthiness of that entity when propagating messages through them on the Tari communication network.
When performing the broadcasting of data messages or propagating discovery requests, nodes with registration assigned node IDs are considered more trustworthy compared to nodes with derived node IDs. </p>
<p>Obtaining a node ID from registration on the Base Layer is important as it will limit the potential of some parties performing <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2015/263.pdf">Eclipse attacks</a> on the network.
Registration makes it more difficult for <a href="Glossary.html#bad-actor">Bad Actor</a>s to position themselves in ideal patterns on the network to perform disruptive operations and actions. 
In sensitive situations or situations where the Kademlia-style directed propagation of messages are vulnerable, gossip protocol-based broadcasting of messages can be performed as a less efficient, but safer alternative to ensure that the message will successfully reach the rest of the network.</p>
<p>The similarity or distance between different node IDs can be calculated by performing the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_distance">Hamming distance</a> between the bits of the two node ID numbers.
The Hamming distance can be implemented as an Exclusive OR (XOR) between the bits of the numbers and the summation of the resulting true bits.
CCs and/or CNs that have similar node IDs, that produce a small Hamming distance, are located in similar regions of the Tari communication network.
This does not mean that their geographic locations are near each other, but rather that their location in the network is similar.
A thresholding scheme can be applied to the Hamming distance to ensure that only neighboring CNs with similar node IDs are allowed to share and propagate specific information.
As an example, only routing table information that contains similar node IDs to the requesting CCs or CNs node ID should be shared with them.
Limiting the sharing of routing table information makes it more difficult to map the entire Tari communication network.</p>
<p>The recommended method of node ID assignment for each Tari communication network entity type MUST be implemented as follows:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th>Entity Type</th><th>Communication Node Type</th><th>Node ID Assignment</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>Validator Node</td><td>Communication Node</td><td>Registration</td></tr>
<tr><td>Base Node</td><td>Communication Node</td><td>Derived</td></tr>
<tr><td>Wallet</td><td>Communication Client</td><td>Derived</td></tr>
<tr><td>Token Wallet</td><td>Communication Client</td><td>Derived</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>Note that <a href="Glossary.html#mining-server">Mining Server</a>s and <a href="Glossary.html#mining-worker">Mining Worker</a>s are excluded from the Tari communication network.
A Mining Worker will have a local or remote P2P connection with a Mining Server.
A Mining Server will have a local or remote P2P connection with a Base Node.
They do not need to make use of the communication network and they are not responsible for propagating any messages on the network.
The parent Base Node will perform any communication tasks on the Tari communication network on their behalf.</p>
<h4 id="online-communication-address-peer-address-and-routing-table"><a class="header" href="#online-communication-address-peer-address-and-routing-table">Online Communication Address, Peer Address and Routing Table</a></h4>
<p>Each CC and CN on the Tari communication network will have identification cryptographic keys, a node ID and an online communication address.
The online communication address SHOULD be either an IPv4, IPv6, URL, Tor (Base32) or I2P (Base32) address and can be stored using the network address type as follows:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th align="left">Description</th><th align="left">Data type</th><th align="left">Comments</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td align="left">address type</td><td align="left">uint4</td><td align="left">Specify if IPv4/IPv6/Url/Tor/I2P</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">address</td><td align="left">char array</td><td align="left">IPv4, IPv6, URL, Tor (Base32), I2P (Base32) address</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">port</td><td align="left">uint16</td><td align="left">port number</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>The address type is used to determine how to interpret the address characters. An I2P address can be interpreted as &quot;{52
address characters}.b32.i2p&quot;. The Tor address should be interpreted as &quot;http://{16_or_52_address_chars}.onion/&quot;. The
IPv4 and IPv6 address can be stored in the address field without modification. URL addresses can be used for nodes with
dynamic IP addresses.</p>
<p>A Tor or I2P address can be used when anonymity is important for a CC or CN.
The IPv4, IPv6 and URL address types do not provide any privacy features but do provide increased bandwidth. </p>
<p>Each CC or CN has a local routing table that contains the online communication addresses of all CCs and CNs on the Tari communication network known to that CC or CN.
When a CC or CN wants to join the Tari communication network, the online communication address of at least one other CN that is part of the network needs to be known.
The online communication address of the initial CN can either be manually provided or a bootstrapped list of &quot;reliable&quot; and persistent CNs can be provided with the Validator Node, Base Node, Wallet or Token Wallet software.
The new CC or CN can then request additional peer contact information of other CNs from the initial peers to extend their own routing table.</p>
<p>The routing table consists of a list of peer addresses that link node IDs, public identification keys and online communication addresses of each known CC and CN.</p>
<p>The Peer Address stored in the routing table MAY be implemented as follows:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th align="left">Description</th><th align="left">Data type</th><th align="left">Comments</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td align="left">network address</td><td align="left">network_address</td><td align="left">The online communication address of the CC or CN</td></tr>

<tr><td align="left">public_key</td><td align="left">public_key</td><td align="left">The public key of the identification cryptographic key of the CC or CN</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">node_type</td><td align="left">node_type</td><td align="left">VN, BN, W or TW</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">linked asset IDs</td><td align="left">list of asset IDs</td><td align="left">Asset IDs can be used as an address on Tari network similar to a node ID</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">last_connection</td><td align="left">timestamp</td><td align="left">Time of last successful connection with peer</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">update_timestamp</td><td align="left">timestamp</td><td align="left">A timestamp for the last peer address update</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>When a new CC or CN wants to join the Tari communication network they need to submit a joining request to the rest of the network.
The joining request contains the peer address of the new CC or CN.
Each CN that receives the joining request can decide if they want to add the new CCs or CNs contact information to their local routing table.
When a CN, that received the joining request, has a similar node ID to the new CC or CN then that node must add the peer address to their routing table.
All CNs with similar node IDs to the new CC or CN should have a copy of the new peer address in their routing tables.</p>
<p>To limit potential attacks, only one registration for a specific node type with the same online communication address can be stored in the routing table of a CN.
This restriction will limit Bad Actors from spinning up multiple CNs on a single computer.</p>
<h4 id="joining-the-network-using-a-joining-request"><a class="header" href="#joining-the-network-using-a-joining-request">Joining the Network using a Joining Request</a></h4>
<p>A new CC or CN needs to register their peer address on the Tari communication network.
This is achieved by submitting a network joining request to a subset of CNs selected from the routing table of the new CC or CN.
These peers will forward the joining request, with the peer address, to the rest of the network until CNs with similar node IDs have been reached.
CNs with similar node IDs will then add the new peer address of the new node to their routing table, allowing for fast discovery of the new CC or CN. </p>
<p>Other CCs and CNs will then be able to retrieve the new CCs or CNs peer address by submitting discovery requests.
Once the peer address of the desired CC or CN has been discovered then a direct P2P communication channel can be established between the two parties for any future communication.
After discovery, the rest of the Tari communication network will be unaware of any further communication between the two parties.</p>
<h4 id="sending-data-messages-and-discovery-requests"><a class="header" href="#sending-data-messages-and-discovery-requests">Sending Data Messages and Discovery Requests</a></h4>
<p>The majority of all communication on the Tari communication network will be performed using direct P2P channels established between different CCs and CNs once they are aware of the peer addresses of each other that contain their online communication addresses.
Message propagation on the network will typically consist only of joining and discovery requests where a CC or CN wants to join the network or retrieve the peer address of another CC or CN so that a direct P2P channel can be established.</p>
<p>Messages can be transmitted in this network in either an unencrypted or encrypted form.
Typically messages that have been sent in unencrypted form are of interest to a number of CNs on the network and should be propagated so that every CN that is interested in that data message obtains a copy.
Block and Transaction propagation are examples of data messages where multiple entities on the Tari communication network are interested in that data message; this requires propagation through the entire Tari communication network in unencrypted form.</p>
<p>Encrypted data messages make use of the source and destinations identification cryptographic keys to construct a shared secret with which the message can be encoded and decoded.
This ensures that only the two parties are able to decode the data message as it is propagated through the communication network.
This mechanism can be used to perform private discovery requests, where the online communication address of the source node is encrypted and propagated through the network until it reached the destination node.
Private discovery requests can only be performed if both parties are online at the same time.
Encryption of the data message ensures that only the destination node is able to view the online address of the source node as the data message moves through the network.
Once the destination node receives and decrypts the data message, that node is then able to establish a P2P communication channel with the source node for any further communication.</p>
<p>Propagation of completely private discovery request, hidden as an encrypted data message, can be performed as a broadcast through the entire network using the Gossip protocol.
Propagation of public discovery requests can be performed using more efficient directed propagation using the Kademlia protocol.
As encrypted message with visible destinations tend to not be of interest to the rest of the network, directed propagation using the Kademlia protocol to forward these messages to the correct parties are preferred.
Privacy of a CCs online address, whom is sending a transaction to a Base Node, may be enhanced if the transaction is encrypted and sent to a Base Node with a node ID that is not the closest to the CCs node ID. This should prevent linking a transaction to the originating online address.</p>
<p>This same encryption technique can be used to send encrypted messages to a single node or a group of nodes, where the group of nodes have shared identification keys.
A Validation Committee is an example of a group of CNs that have shared identification keys for the committee.
The shared identification keys ensure that all members of that committee are able to receive and decrypt data messages that were sent to the committee.</p>
<h4 id="maintaining-connections-with-peers"><a class="header" href="#maintaining-connections-with-peers">Maintaining connections with peers</a></h4>
<p>CCs and CNs establish and maintain connections with peers differently.
CCs only create a few short-lived ad hoc channels and CNs create and maintain long-lived channels with a number of peers.</p>
<p>If a CC is unaware of a destination CNs or CCs online communication address then the address first needs to be obtained using a discovery request.
When a CC already knows the communication address of the CC or CN that he wants to communicate with, then a direct P2P channel can be established between the two peers for the duration of the communication task.
The communication channel can then be closed as soon as the communication task has been completed.</p>
<p>CNs consisting of VNs and BNs typically attempt to maintain communication channels with a large number of peers.
The distribution of peers (VNs vs BNs) that a single CN keeps communication channels open with can change depending on the type of node.
A CN that is also a BN should maintain more peer connections with other BNs, but should also have some connections with other VNs.</p>
<p>Having some connections with VNs are important as BNs have derived node IDs and not registered node IDs such as VNs, making it possible for the CN to be separated from the main network and become victim to an <a href="https://www.radixdlt.com/post/what-is-an-eclipse-attack">Eclipse attack</a>.
Having some connections with VNs will make it more difficult to separate the CN from the network and will ensure successful propagation of transactions and completed blocks from that CN. </p>
<p>A CN that is also a VN should maintain more peer connections with other VNs, but also have some connections with BNs.
CNs that are part of Validator Node committees should attempt to maintain permanent connections with the other members of the committee to ensure that quick consensus can be achieved.</p>
<p>To maintain connections with peers, the following process can be performed.
Discover peers using discovery requests, and add their details to the local routing table.
The CN can decide how the peer connections should be selected from the routing table by either:</p>
<ul>
<li>manually selecting a subset,</li>
<li>automatically selecting a random subset or</li>
<li>selecting a subset of neighbouring nodes with similar node IDs. </li>
</ul>
<p>Maintaining communication channels is important and the following process can be followed in an attempt to keep peer connections alive:
For an existing peer connection.
When more than 30 minutes have passed since the last communication with that peer, then a heartbeat message should be sent to the peer in an attempt to keep the connection with the peer alive.
If the peer connection was not established for a specific purpose, such as with the connections between committee members, then a new replacement peer can be selected from the local routing table.
A new connection can then be established and maintained between the current node and the newly selected node.
If that specific connection is important, such as with the connections between committee members, then the current CN or CC must wait and attempt to create a new connection with that same peer.
If more than 90 minutes have passed since the last successful communication with the peer node, a new discovery request can be sent on the Tari communication network in an attempt to locate that peer again.
Losing of a peer might happen in cases where the CN or CC went temporarily offline and their dynamic communication address changed, requiring the discovery process to be performed again before a direct P2P communication channel can be established.</p>

<p>The aim of this Request for Comment (RFC) is to describe the message serialization formats for message payloads used in the Tari network.</p>

<p><a href="RFC-0170_NetworkCommunicationProtocol.html">RFC-0710: Tari Communication Network and Network Communication Protocol</a></p>
<h2 id="description-10"><a class="header" href="#description-10">Description</a></h2>
<p>One way of interpreting the Tari network is that it is a large peer-to-peer messaging application. The entities chatting
on the network include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Users</li>
<li>Wallets</li>
<li>Base nodes</li>
<li>Validator nodes</li>
</ul>
<p>The types of messages that these entities send might include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Text messages</li>
<li>Transaction messages</li>
<li>Block propagation messages</li>
<li>Asset creation instructions</li>
<li>Asset state change instructions</li>
<li>State Checkpoint messages</li>
</ul>
<p>For successful communication to occur, the following needs to happen:</p>
<ul>
<li>The message is translated from its memory storage format into a standard payload format that will be transported over
the wire.</li>
<li>The communication module wraps the payload into a message format, which may entail any/all of
<ul>
<li>adding a message header to describe the type of payload;</li>
<li>encrypting the message;</li>
<li>signing the message;</li>
<li>adding destination/recipient metadata.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The communication module then sends the message over the wire.</li>
<li>The recipient receives the message and unwraps it, possibly performing any/all of the following:
<ul>
<li>decryption;</li>
<li>verifying signatures;</li>
<li>extracting the payload;</li>
<li>passing the serialized payload to modules that are interesting in that particular message type.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The message is deserialized into the correct data structure for use by the receiving software</li>
</ul>
<p>This document only covers the first and last steps, i.e. serializing data from in-memory objects to a format that can
be transmitted over the wire. The other steps are handled by the Tari communication protocol.</p>
<p>In addition to machine-to-machine communication, we also standardize on human-to-machine communication. Use cases for
this include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Handcrafting instructions or transactions. The ideal format here is a very human-readable format.</li>
<li>Copying transactions or instructions from cold wallets. The ideal format here is a compact but easy-to-copy format.</li>
<li>Peer-to-peer text messaging. This is just a special case of what has already been described, with the message
structure containing a unicode <code>message_text</code> field.</li>
</ul>
<p>When sending a message from a human to the network, the following happens:</p>
<ul>
<li>The message is deserialized into the native structure.</li>
<li>The deserialization acts as an automatic validation step.</li>
<li>Additional validation can be performed.</li>
<li>The usual machine-to-machine process is followed, as described above.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="binary-serialization-formats"><a class="header" href="#binary-serialization-formats">Binary Serialization Formats</a></h3>
<p>The ideal properties for binary serialization formats are:</p>
<ul>
<li>widely used across multiple platforms and languages, but with excellent Rust support;</li>
<li>compact binary representation; and</li>
<li>serialization &quot;Just Works&quot;(TM) with little or no additional coding overhead.</li>
</ul>
<p>Several candidates fulfill these properties to some degree.</p>

<ul>
<li>Pros:
<ul>
<li>Very mature (was developed in the 1980s)</li>
<li>Large number of implementations</li>
<li>Dovetails nicely into ZMQ </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Cons:
<ul>
<li>Limited Rust/Serde support</li>
<li>Requires schema (additional coding overhead if no automated tools for this exist)</li>

<ul>
<li>Pros:
<ul>
<li>Very compact</li>
<li>Fast</li>
<li>Multiple language support</li>
<li>Good Rust/Serde support</li>

<p>Similar to Message Pack, but also requires schemas to be written and compiled. Serialization 
performance and size
are similar to Message Pack. It Can work with ZMQ, but is better designed to be used with gRPC.</p>
<h4 id="a-hrefhttpkentonvgithubiocapnprotocapn-protoa"><a class="header" href="#a-hrefhttpkentonvgithubiocapnprotocapn-protoa"><a href="http://kentonv.github.io/capnproto/">Cap'n Proto</a></a></h4>
<p>Similar to Protobuf, but claims to be much faster. Rust is supported.</p>
<h4 id="hand-rolled-serialization"><a class="header" href="#hand-rolled-serialization">Hand-rolled Serialization</a></h4>
<p><a href="http://zguide.zeromq.org/py:chapter7#Serialization-Libraries">Hintjens recommends</a> using hand-rolled serialization for
bulk messaging. While Pieter usually offers sage advice, I'm going to argue against using custom serializers at this
stage for the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>We're unlikely to improve hugely over MessagePack.</li>
<li>Since Serde does 95% of our work for us with MessagePack, there's a significant development overhead (and new bugs)
involved with a hand-rolled solution.</li>
<li>We'd have to write de/serializers for every language that wants Tari bindings; whereas every major language has a
MessagePack implementation.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="serialization-in-tari"><a class="header" href="#serialization-in-tari">Serialization in Tari</a></h3>
<p>Deciding between these protocols is largely a matter of preference, since there isn't that much difference between them.
Given that ZMQ is used in other places in the Tari network, MessagePack looks to be a good fit while offering a compact
data structure and highly performant de/serialization. In Rust, in particular, there's first-class support for MessagePack
in Serde.</p>
<p>For human-readable formats, it makes little sense to deviate from JSON. For copy-paste semantics, the extra compression
that Base64 offers over raw hex or Base58 makes it attractive.</p>
<p>Many Tari data types' binary representation will be the straightforward MessagePack version of each field in the related
<code>struct</code>. In these cases, a straightforward <code>#[derive(Deserialize, Serialize)]</code> is all that is required to enable the data
structure to be sent over the wire.</p>
<p>However, other structures might need fine-tuning, or hand-written serialization procedures. To capture both use cases,
it is proposed that a <code>MessageFormat</code> trait be defined:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust compile_fail">
<span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>pub trait MessageFormat: Sized {
    fn to_binary(&amp;self) -&gt; Result&lt;Vec&lt;u8&gt;, MessageFormatError&gt;;
    fn to_json(&amp;self) -&gt; Result&lt;String, MessageFormatError&gt;;
    fn to_base64(&amp;self) -&gt; Result&lt;String, MessageFormatError&gt;;

    fn from_binary(msg: &amp;[u8]) -&gt; Result&lt;Self, MessageFormatError&gt;;
    fn from_json(msg: &amp;str) -&gt; Result&lt;Self, MessageFormatError&gt;;
    fn from_base64(msg: &amp;str) -&gt; Result&lt;Self, MessageFormatError&gt;;
}
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>This trait will have default implementations to cover most use cases (e.g. a simple call through to <code>serde_json</code>). Serde
also offers significant ability to tweak how a given struct will be serialized through the use of
<a href="https://serde.rs/attributes.html">attributes</a>.</p>

<h3 id="broad-requirements-1"><a class="header" href="#broad-requirements-1">Broad Requirements</a></h3>
<p>Tari network peer communication must facilitate secure, private and efficient communication
between peers. Broadly, a <a href="Glossary.html#communication-node">communication node</a> or <a href="Glossary.html#communication-client">communication client</a> MUST be capable of:</p>
<ul>
<li>bidirectional communication between multiple connected peers;</li>
<li>private and secure over-the-wire communication;</li>
<li>understanding and constructing Tari messages;</li>
<li>encrypting and decrypting message payloads;</li>
<li>gracefully reestablishing dropped connections; and (optionally)</li>
<li>communicating to a SOCKS5 proxy (for connections over Tor and I2P).</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, communication nodes MUST be capable of performing the following tasks:</p>
<ul>
<li>opening a control port for establishing secure peer channels;</li>
<li>maintaining a list of known peers in the form of a routing table;</li>
<li>forwarding directed messages to neighbouring peers; and</li>
<li>broadcasting messages to neighbouring peers.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="overall-architectural-design"><a class="header" href="#overall-architectural-design">Overall Architectural Design</a></h3>
<p>The Tari communication layer has a modular design to allow for the various communicating nodes and clients to
use the same infrastructure code.</p>
<p>The design is influenced by an open-source library called <a href="http://zeromq.org/">ZeroMQ</a> and the ZeroMQ C bindings are a dependency of
the project. ZeroMQ's over-the-wire protocol is relatively simple, and replicating ZeroMQ framing in a custom
implementation should not be prohibitively difficult. However, ZeroMQ offers many valuable features, which would be a 
significantly larger undertaking to reproduce. Fortunately, bindings or native ports are available in numerous languages.</p>
<p>To learn more about ZeroMQ, read <a href="http://zguide.zeromq.org/page:all">the guide</a>. It's an enjoyable and worthwhile read.</p>
<p>A quick overview of what ZeroMQ provides:</p>
<ul>
<li>A simple socket Application Programming Interface (API).</li>
<li>Some well-defined patterns to connect sockets together.</li>
<li>Sockets that are tiny asynchronous message queues, which:
<ul>
<li>abstract away complexity around the underlying socket;</li>
<li>are transport agnostic, meaning you can choose between Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), Pragmatic General 
Multicast (PGM), Inter-process Communication (IPC) and in-process (inproc) transports with little or no changes to code; 
and</li>
<li>transparently reconnect when connections are dropped.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The <code>inproc</code> transport for message passing between threads without mutex locks.</li>
<li>Built-in protocol for asymmetric encryption over the wire using Curve25519.</li>
<li>Ability to send and receive multipart messages using a simple framing scheme. More info <a href="http://zguide.zeromq.org/php:chapter2#toc11">here</a>.</li>
<li>Support for Secure Socket (SOCKS) proxies.</li>
</ul>
<p>This document will refer to several <a href="http://api.zeromq.org/2-1:zmq-socket">ZeroMQ socket</a>s. These are referred to by prepending <code>ZMQ_</code> and the name
of the socket in capitals. For example, <code>ZMQ_ROUTER</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Note about ZeroMQ frames and multipart messages:</strong></p>
<p>ZeroMQ frames are length-specified blocks of binary data and can be strung together to make multipart messages.</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">|5|H|E|L|L|O|*|0|*|3|F|O|O|+|
* = more flag
+ = no more flag
</code></pre>
<p><em>A multipart message consisting of three frames &quot;HELLO&quot;, a zero-length frame and &quot;FOO&quot;</em></p>
<p>When this RFC mentions 'multipart messages', this is what it's referring to.</p>
<h4 id="establishing-a-connection"><a class="header" href="#establishing-a-connection">Establishing a Connection</a></h4>
<p>Every participating <a href="Glossary.html#communication-node">communication node</a> SHOULD open a control socket (refer to <a href="RFC-0172_PeerToPeerMessagingProtocol.html#controlservice">ControlService</a>) to allow peers to negotiate and
establish a peer connection. The <a href="RFC-0172_PeerToPeerMessagingProtocol.html#netaddress">NetAddress</a> of the control socket is what is stored in peers' routing tables and will
be used to establish new ephemeral <a href="RFC-0172_PeerToPeerMessagingProtocol.html#peerconnection">PeerConnection</a>s. Any peer that wants to connect MUST establish a connection
to the control socket of the destination peer to negotiate a new encrypted PeerConnection.</p>
<p>Once a connection is established, messages can be sent and received directly to or from the <a href="RFC-0172_PeerToPeerMessagingProtocol.html#peer">Peer</a>.</p>
<p>Incoming messages are validated, deserialized and handled as appropriate.</p>
<h4 id="encryption"><a class="header" href="#encryption">Encryption</a></h4>
<p>Two forms of encryption are used:</p>
<ul>
<li>Over-the-wire encryption, in which traffic between nodes is encrypted using ZMQ's <a href="http://curvezmq.org/page:read-the-docs">CURVE</a>
implementation.</li>
<li>Payload encryption, in which the <a href="RFC-0172_PeerToPeerMessagingProtocol.html#messageenvelopebody">MessageEnvelopeBody</a> is encrypted in such a way that it can only be decrypted by the

<p>As this is part of the <a href="RFC-0172_PeerToPeerMessagingProtocol.html#messageenvelopebody">MessageEnvelopeBody</a>, it can be encrypted along with the rest of the message,
which keeps the type of message private.</p>
<h4 id="messagebody"><a class="header" href="#messagebody">MessageBody</a></h4>
<p>Messages are an intention to perform a task. MessageType names should thus be a verb such as <code>net::Join</code> or <code>blockchain::AddBlock</code>.</p>
<p>All messages can be categorized as follows; each categorization has rules for how they should be handled:</p>
<ul>
<li>A propagation message
<ul>
<li>SHOULD NOT have a destination in the MessageHeader;</li>
<li>MUST be forwarded;</li>
<li>SHOULD use the <code>Random</code> BroadcastStrategy;</li>
<li>SHOULD discard a message that it has seen within the <a href="RFC-0172_PeerToPeerMessagingProtocol.html#duplicatemessagewindow">DuplicateMessageWindow</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A direct message
<ul>
<li>MUST have a destination in the MessageHeader;</li>
<li>SHOULD be discarded if it does not have a destination;</li>
<li>SHOULD discard a message that it has seen before;</li>
<li>MUST use the <code>Direct</code> BroadcastStrategy if a destination peer is known;</li>
<li>SHOULD use the <code>Closest</code> BroadcastStrategy if a destination peer is not known.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>An encrypted message
<ul>
<li>MUST undergo an attempt to be decrypted by all recipients;</li>
<li>MUST be forwarded by recipients if it cannot be decrypted;</li>
<li>SHOULD discard a message that it has seen before.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The <a href="RFC-0172_PeerToPeerMessagingProtocol.html#messagetype">MessageType</a> in the header MUST be used to determine the type of the message deserialized.
If the deserialization fails, the message SHOULD be discarded.</p>
<h4 id="duplicatemessagewindow"><a class="header" href="#duplicatemessagewindow">DuplicateMessageWindow</a></h4>
<p>A configurable length of time for which message signatures should be tracked in order to eliminate duplicate messages.
This should be long enough to make it highly unlikely that a particular message will be processed again
and short enough to not be a burden on the node.</p>
<h4 id="inboundconnection"><a class="header" href="#inboundconnection">InboundConnection</a></h4>
<p>A thin wrapper around a <code>ZMQ_ROUTER</code> socket, which binds to a <a href="RFC-0172_PeerToPeerMessagingProtocol.html#netaddress">NetAddress</a> and accepts incoming multipart messages.
This connection blocks until there is data to read, or a timeout is reached. In both cases, the <code>receive</code> method
can be called again (i.e. in a loop) to continue listening for messages. Client code should run this loop in its own thread.
<code>send</code> is only called (if at all) in response to an incoming message.</p>
<p>Fields may include</p>
<ul>
<li>a NetAddress;</li>
<li>a timeout;</li>
<li>underlying <a href="http://api.zeromq.org/2-1:zmq-socket">ZeroMQ socket</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Methods may include:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>receive()</code></li>
<li><code>send(data)</code></li>
<li><code>set_encryption(secret_key)</code></li>
<li><code>set_socks_proxy(address)</code></li>
<li><code>set_hwm(v)</code></li>
</ul>
<p>An InboundConnection:</p>
<ul>
<li>MUST perform the &quot;server-side&quot; <a href="http://curvezmq.org/page:read-the-docs">CurveZMQ</a> encryption protocol if encryption is set.
<ul>
<li>Using <a href="http://zeromq.org/">ZeroMQ</a>. this means setting the socketopts <code>ZMQ_CURVE_SERVER</code> to 1 and <code>ZMQ_CURVE_SECRETKEY</code> to the secret key before binding.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>MUST listen for and accept TCP connections.
<ul>
<li>For an IP NetAddress, bind on the given host IP and port.</li>
<li>For an Onion NetAddress, bind on 127.0.0.1 and the given port.</li>
<li>For an I2P NetAddress, as yet undetermined.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>MUST read multipart messages and return them to the caller.
<ul>
<li>If the timeout is reached, return an error to be handled by the calling code.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="outboundconnection"><a class="header" href="#outboundconnection">OutboundConnection</a></h4>
<p>A thin wrapper around a <code>ZMQ_DEALER</code> socket, which connects to a <a href="RFC-0172_PeerToPeerMessagingProtocol.html#netaddress">NetAddress</a> and sends outbound multipart messages.
This connection blocks until data can be written, or a timeout is reached. The timeout should never be reached, as
<a href="http://zeromq.org/">ZeroMQ</a> internally queues messages to be sent.</p>
<p>Fields may include:</p>
<ul>
<li>a NetAddress;</li>
<li>underlying <a href="http://api.zeromq.org/2-1:zmq-socket">ZeroMQ socket</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Methods may include:</p>

<li><code>disconnect()</code></li>
<li><code>set_encryption(server_pk, client_pk, client_sk)</code></li>
<li><code>set_socks_proxy(address)</code></li>
<li><code>set_hwm(v)</code></li>
</ul>
<p>An OutboundConnection:</p>
<ul>
<li>MUST perform the &quot;client-side&quot; <a href="http://curvezmq.org/page:read-the-docs">CurveZMQ</a> encryption protocol if encryption is set.
<ul>
<li>Using ZeroMQ, this means setting the socketopts <code>ZMQ_CURVE_SERVERKEY</code>, <code>ZMQ_CURVE_SECRETKEY</code> and <code>ZMQ_CURVE_PUBLICKEY</code>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>MUST connect to a TCP endpoint.
<ul>
<li>For an IP NetAddress, connect to the given host IP and port.</li>
<li>For an Onion NetAddress, connect to the onion address using the TCP, e.g. <code>tcp://xyz...123.onion:1234</code>.</li>
<li>For an I2P NetAddress, as yet undetermined.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>MUST write the parts of the given MessageEnvelope to the socket as a multipart message consisting of, in order:
<ul>
<li>identity;</li>
<li>version;</li>
<li>header;</li>
<li>body.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If specified, MUST set a High Water Mark (HWM) on the underlying ZeroMQ socket.</li>
<li>If the HWM is reached, a call to <code>send</code> MUST return an error and any messages received SHOULD be discarded.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="peer"><a class="header" href="#peer">Peer</a></h4>
<p>A single peer that can communicate on the Tari network.</p>
<p>Fields may include:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>addresses</code> - a list of <a href="RFC-0172_PeerToPeerMessagingProtocol.html#netaddress">NetAddress</a>es associated with the peer, perhaps accompanied by some bookkeeping metadata, such 
as preferred address;</li>
<li><code>node_type</code> - the type of node or client, i.e. <a href="Glossary.html#base-node">BaseNode</a>, <a href="Glossary.html#validator-node">ValidatorNode</a>, <a href="Glossary.html#wallet">Wallet</a> or <a href="Glossary.html#token-wallet">TokenWallet</a>);</li>
<li><code>last_seen</code> - a timestamp of the last time a message has been sent/received from this peer;</li>
<li><code>flags</code> - 8-bit flag;
<ul>
<li>bit 0: is_banned,</li>
<li>bit 1-7: reserved.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>A peer may also contain reputation metrics (e.g. rejected_message_count, avg_latency) to be used to decide
if a peer should be banned. This mechanism is yet to be decided.</p>
<h4 id="peerconnection"><a class="header" href="#peerconnection">PeerConnection</a></h4>
<p>Represents direct bidirectional connection to another node or client. As connections are bidirectional,
the PeerConnection need only hold a single <a href="RFC-0172_PeerToPeerMessagingProtocol.html#inboundconnection">InboundConnection</a> or <a href="RFC-0172_PeerToPeerMessagingProtocol.html#outboundconnection">OutboundConnection</a>, depending on if the
node requested a peer connect to it or if it is connecting to a peer.</p>
<p>PeerConnection will send messages to the peer in a non-blocking, asynchronous manner as long as the connection
is maintained.</p>
<p>It has a few important functions:</p>
<ul>
<li>managing the underlying network connections, with automatic reconnection if necessary;</li>
<li>forwarding incoming messages onto the given handler socket; and</li>
<li>sending outgoing messages.</li>
</ul>
<p>Unlike InboundConnection and OutboundConnection, which are essentially stateless,
<code>PeerConnection</code> maintains a particular <code>ConnectionState</code>.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Idle</code> - the connection has not been established.</li>
<li><code>Connecting</code> - the connection is in progress.</li>
<li><code>Connected</code> - the connection has been established.</li>
<li><code>Suspended</code> - the connection has been suspended. Incoming messages will be discarded, calls to <code>send()</code> will error.</li>
<li><code>Dead</code> - the connection is no longer active because the connection was dropped.</li>
<li><code>Shutdown</code> - the connection is no longer active because it was shut down.</li>
</ul>
<p>Fields may include:</p>
<ul>
<li>a connection state;</li>
<li>a control socket;</li>
<li>a peer connection <code>NetAddress</code>;</li>
<li>a direction (either <code>Inbound</code> or <code>Outbound</code>);</li>
<li>a public key obtained from the connection negotiation;</li>
<li>(optional) SOCKS proxy.</li>
</ul>
<p>Methods may include:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>establish()</code></li>
<li><code>shutdown()</code></li>
<li><code>suspend()</code></li>
<li><code>resume()</code></li>
<li><code>send(msg)</code></li>
</ul>
<p>A <code>PeerConnection</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li>MUST listen for data on the given <a href="RFC-0172_PeerToPeerMessagingProtocol.html#netaddress">NetAddress</a> using an InboundConnection;</li>
<li>MUST sequentially try to connect to one of the peer's NetAddresses until one succeeds or all fail using an OutboundConnection;</li>
<li>MUST immediately reject and dispose of a multipart message not consisting of four parts, as detailed in MessageEnvelope;</li>
<li>MUST construct a MessageEnvelope from the multiple parts;</li>
<li>MUST pass the constructed MessageEnvelope to the message handler;</li>
<li>MUST transition to <code>Connecting</code> state and retry the connection, should a connection drop;</li>
<li>MUST send a <code>net::Disconnect</code> message and drop the connection when a shutdown signal is received.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="connectionmanager"><a class="header" href="#connectionmanager">ConnectionManager</a></h4>
<p>The ConnectionManager manages a set of live PeerConnections. It provides an abstraction for other components
to initiate and use PeerConnections without having to worry about attaching the new PeerConnection to message handlers.</p>
<p>It consists of a list of active peer connections and an <code>inproc</code> message handler socket. This socket is 'written to' whenever
a message is received from any active <a href="RFC-0172_PeerToPeerMessagingProtocol.html#peerconnection">PeerConnection</a> for other components to act on.</p>
<p>Methods may include:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>establish_connection(Peer)</code> - create and return a new PeerConnection;</li>
<li><code>disconnect(peer)</code> - disconnect a particular peer;</li>
<li><code>suspend()</code> - temporarily suspend connections;</li>
<li><code>resume()</code> - temporarily suspend connections;</li>
<li><code>shutdown</code> - cleanly shut down all PeerConnections.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <code>ConnectionManager</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li>MUST call <code>suspend</code> on every PeerConnection if its <code>suspend</code> method is called;</li>
<li>MUST call <code>resume</code> on every PeerConnection if its <code>resume</code> method is called;</li>
<li>MUST call <code>shutdown</code> on every PeerConnection if its <code>shutdown</code> method is called</li>
<li>MUST create a new PeerConnection with the given Peer and NetAddress, when <code>establish_connection</code> is called;</li>
<li>MUST call <code>shutdown</code> on the PeerConnection and remove the connection for the given peer, when <code>disconnect(peer)</code> is called;</li>
<li>MAY disconnect peers if the connection has not been used for an extended period;</li>
<li>SHOULD disconnect the least recently used peer if the connection pool is greater than <code>max connections</code></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="controlservice"><a class="header" href="#controlservice">ControlService</a></h4>
<p>The purpose of this service is to negotiate a new secure PeerConnection.</p>
<p>The control service accepts a single message:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>peer::EstablishConnection(pk, curve_pk, net_address)</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>A ControlService:</p>
<ul>
<li>MUST listen for connections on a predefined CONTROL PORT;</li>
<li>SHOULD deny connections from banned peers.</li>
</ul>
<p>The steps to establish a peer connection are as follows:</p>
<p>Alice wants to connect to Bob</p>
<ol>
<li>Alice creates a <code>PeerConnection</code> to which Bob can connect.
<ul>
<li>A new CURVE key pair is generated.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Alice connects to Bob's control server and Bob accepts the connection.</li>
<li>Alice sends a <code>peer::establish_connection</code> message, with:
<ul>
<li>the CURVE public key for the socket connection;</li>
<li>the node's public key corresponding to its <a href="Glossary.html#node-id">Node ID</a>; and</li>
<li>the <a href="RFC-0172_PeerToPeerMessagingProtocol.html#netaddress">NetAddress</a> of the new PeerConnection.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Bob accepts this request and opens a new <code>PeerConnnection</code> socket using Alice's CURVE public key.</li>
<li>Bob connects to the given NetAddress and sends a <code>peer::establish_connection</code> message.</li>
<li>If Alice accepts the connection, they can begin sending messages. If not, both sides terminate the connection.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="peermanager"><a class="header" href="#peermanager">PeerManager</a></h4>
<p>The PeerManager is responsible for managing the list of peers with which the node has previously interacted.
This list is called a routing table and is made up of <a href="RFC-0172_PeerToPeerMessagingProtocol.html#peer">Peer</a>s.</p>
<p>The PeerManager can</p>
<ul>
<li>add a peer to the routing table;</li>
<li>search for a peer given a node ID, public key or <a href="RFC-0172_PeerToPeerMessagingProtocol.html#netaddress">NetAddress</a>;</li>
<li>delete a peer from the list;</li>
<li>persist the peer list using a storage backend;</li>
<li>restore the peer list from the storage backend;</li>
<li>maintain lightweight views of peers, using a filter criterion, e.g. a list of peers that have been banned, i.e. a denylist; and</li>
<li>prune the routing table based on a filter criterion, e.g. last date seen.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="messagedispatcher"><a class="header" href="#messagedispatcher">MessageDispatcher</a></h4>
<p>The MessageContext contains:</p>
<ul>
<li>the requesting PeerConnection;</li>
<li>the MessageHeader;</li>
<li>the deserialized message;</li>
<li>the OutboundMessageService.</li>
</ul>
<p>Basically, all the tools the handler needs to interact with the network.</p>
<p>A MessageDispatcher is responsible for:</p>
<ul>
<li>constructing the MessageContext;</li>
<li>finding the message handler that is associated with the MessageType;</li>
<li>passing the MessageContext to the handler; and</li>
<li>ignoring the message if the handler cannot be found.</li>
</ul>
<p>An example API may be:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust compile_fail">

    .route(NetMessageType::Ping, send_pong);

inbound_msg_service.set_handler(dispatcher.handler);
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<h4 id="inboundmessageservice"><a class="header" href="#inboundmessageservice">InboundMessageService</a></h4>
<p>InboundMessageService is a service that receives messages over a non-blocking asynchronous socket and
determines what to do with it. There are three options: handle, forward and discard.</p>
<p>A pool of worker threads (with a configurable size) is started and each one listens for messages on its $1:n$ <code>inproc</code> message
socket. A <code>ZMQ_DEALER</code> socket is suggested for fair-queueing work amongst workers, who listen for work with a <code>ZMQ_REP</code>.
The workers read off this socket and process the messages.</p>
<p>An InboundMessageService:</p>
<ul>
<li>MUST receive messages from all PeerConnections; and</li>
<li>MUST write the message to the worker socket.</li>
</ul>
<p>A worker:</p>
<ul>
<li>MUST deserialize the MessageHeader.
<ul>
<li>If unable to deserialize, MUST discard the message.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>MUST check the message signature.
<ul>
<li>MUST discard the message if the signature is invalid.</li>
<li>MUST discard the message if the signature has been processed within the <a href="RFC-0172_PeerToPeerMessagingProtocol.html#duplicatemessagewindow">DuplicateMessageWindow</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If the encryption flag is set:
<ul>
<li>MUST attempt to decrypt the message.
<ul>
<li>If successful, process and handle the message.</li>
<li>Otherwise, MUST forward the message using the <code>Random</code> BroadcastStrategy.</li>
<li>If the message is not encrypted, MUST discard it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If the destination <a href="Glossary.html#node-id">node ID</a> is set:
<ul>
<li>If the destination matches this node's ID - process and handle the message.</li>
<li>If the destination does not match this node's ID - MUST forward the message using the <code>Closest</code> BroadcastStrategy.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If the destination is not set
<ul>
<li>If the MessageType is a kind of propagation message:
<ul>
<li>MUST handle the message;</li>
<li>MUST forward the message using the <code>Random</code> BroadcastStrategy.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If the MessageType is a kind of encrypted message:
<ul>
<li>MUST attempt to decrypt and handle the message;</li>
<li>if successful, MUST handle the message;</li>
<li>if unsuccessful, MUST forward the message using the <code>Random</code> or <code>Flood</code> BroadcastStrategy,</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="outboundmessageservice"><a class="header" href="#outboundmessageservice">OutboundMessageService</a></h4>
<p>OutboundMessageService is responsible for using the connection and peer infrastructure to
send messages to the rest of the network.</p>
<p>In particular, it is responsible for:</p>
<ul>
<li>serializing the message body;</li>
<li>constructing the MessageEnvelope;</li>
<li>executing the required BroadcastStrategy; and</li>
<li>sending messages using the [ConnectionManager].</li>
</ul>
<p>The actual sending of messages can be requested via the public <code>send_message</code> method, which takes a
MessageHeader, MessageBody and BroadcastStrategy as parameters.</p>
<p><code>send_message</code> then selects an appropriate peer(s) from the ConnectionManager according to the
BroadcastStrategy and sends the message to each of the selected peers.</p>
<p>BroadcastStrategy determines how a set of peer nodes will be selected and can be:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Direct</code> - send to a particular peer matching the given <a href="Glossary.html#node-id">node ID</a>;</li>
<li><code>Flood</code> - send to all known peers who are not [communication clients];</li>
<li><code>Closest</code> - send to $n$ closest peers who are not [communication clients]; or</li>
<li><code>Random</code> - send to a random set of peers of size $n$ who are not [communication clients].</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="privacy-features"><a class="header" href="#privacy-features">Privacy Features</a></h3>
<p>The following privacy features are proposed:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <a href="Glossary.html#communication-node">communication node</a> or <a href="Glossary.html#communication-client">communication client</a> MAY communicate solely over the Tor/I2P networks.</li>
<li>All traffic (with the exception of the control service) MUST be encrypted.</li>
<li>Messages MAY encrypt the body of a MessageEnvelope, which only a particular recipient can decrypt.</li>
<li>The <code>destination</code> header field can be omitted when used in conjunction with body encryption; the destination is
completely unknown to the rest of the network.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="store-and-forward-strategy"><a class="header" href="#store-and-forward-strategy">Store and Forward Strategy</a></h3>
<p>Sometimes it may be desirable for messages to be sent without a destination node/client being online. This
is especially important for a modern chat/messaging application.</p>
<p>The mechanism for this is proposed as follows:</p>
<p>Each <a href="Glossary.html#communication-node">communication node</a> MUST allocate some disk space for storage of messages for offline recipients.
Only some allowlisted MessageTypes are permitted to be stored. A sender sends a message destined for a particular
<a href="Glossary.html#node-id">node ID</a> to its closest peers, which forward the message to their closest peers, and so on.</p>
<p>Eventually, the message will reach nodes that either know the destination or are very close to the destination.
These nodes MUST store the message in some pending message bucket for the destination. The maximum number of
buckets and the size of each bucket SHOULD be sufficiently large as to be unlikely to overflow, but not so
large as to approach disk space problems. Individual messages should be small and responsibilities for
storage spread over the entire network.</p>
<p>A communication node</p>
<ul>
<li>MUST store messages for later retransmission, if all of the following conditions are true:
<ul>
<li>the MessageType is permitted to be stored;</li>
<li>there are fewer than $n$ closer online peers to the destination.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>MUST retransmit pending messages when a closer peer comes online or is added to the routing table.</li>
<li>MAY remove a bucket, in any of the following conditions:
<ul>
<li>The bucket is empty;</li>
<li>A configured maximum number of buckets has been reached. Discard the bucket with the earliest creation timestamp.</li>
<li>The number of closer online peers to the destination is equal to or has exceeded $n$.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>MAY expire individual messages after a sufficiently long Time to Live (TTL)</li>
</ul>
<p>This approach has the following benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>When a destination comes online, it will receive pending messages without having to query them.</li>
<li>The &quot;closer within a threshold&quot; metric is simple.</li>
<li>Messages are stored on multiple peers, which makes it less likely for messages to disappear as nodes come and go
(depending on threshold $n$).</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="queue-overflow-strategy"><a class="header" href="#queue-overflow-strategy">Queue Overflow Strategy</a></h3>
<p>Inbound/OutboundConnections (and therefore PeerConnection) have an HWM set.</p>
<p>If the HWM is hit:</p>
<ul>
<li>any call to <code>send()</code> should return an error; and</li>
<li>incoming messages should be silently discarded.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="outstanding-items"><a class="header" href="#outstanding-items">Outstanding Items</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>A PeerConnection will probably need to implement a heartbeat to detect if a peer has gone offline.</li>
<li>InboundConnection(Service) may want to send small replies (such as OK, ERR) when the message has been accepted or rejected.</li>
<li>OutboundConnection(Service) may want to receive and handle small replies.</li>
<li>Encrypted communication for the <a href="RFC-0172_PeerToPeerMessagingProtocol.html#controlservice">ControlService</a> would be better privacy, but since ZMQ requires a CURVE public key before
the connection is bound, a dedicated &quot;secure connection negotiation socket&quot; would be needed.</li>
<li>Details of distributed message storage.</li>
<li>Which <a href="RFC-0172_PeerToPeerMessagingProtocol.html#netaddress">NetAddress</a> to use if a peer has many.</li>

<li>Each <a href="Glossary.html#base-node">base node</a> is connected to a number of peers that maintain their own copies of the Mempool.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="abstract-2"><a class="header" href="#abstract-2">Abstract</a></h3>
<p>The Mempool is responsible for managing, verifying and maintaining all unconfirmed transactions that have not yet 
been included in a <a href="Glossary.html#block">block</a> and added to the Tari <a href="Glossary.html#blockchain">blockchain</a>. It consists of a Transaction Pool, Pending Pool, 
Orphan Pool and Reorg Pool to achieve these tasks. It is also responsible for propagating valid transactions and 
sharing the Mempool state with connected peers. An overview of the required functionality for the Mempool and each 
of its component pools will be provided.</p>
<h3 id="overview-1"><a class="header" href="#overview-1">Overview</a></h3>
<p>Every base node maintains a Mempool that consists of four separate pools: the Transaction Pool, Pending Pool, 
Orphan Pool and Reorg Pool. These four pools have different tasks and work together to form the Mempool used 
for maintaining unconfirmed transactions. </p>
<p>This is the role descriptions for each component pool:</p>
<ul>
<li>Transaction Pool: contains all unconfirmed transactions that have been verified, have passed all checks, that 
only spend valid <a href="Glossary.html#unspent-transaction-outputs">UTXO</a>s and don't have any time-lock restrictions.</li>
<li>Pending Pool: contains unconfirmed transactions that have time-lock restrictions. The transactions in this pool 
either attempt to spend UTXOs with time-locks or the transactions themselves have time-locks limiting them from 
being included in new blocks until a specified future time or block height has been reached. </li>
<li>Orphan Pool: out of order unconfirmed transactions are managed by this pool, these transactions attempt to spend 
non-existent UTXOs.</li>
<li>Reorg Pool: stores a backup of all transactions that have recently been included into blocks, in case a blockchain 
reorganization occurs and these transactions have to be restored to the Transaction Pool so that they can be included 
in future blocks.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="prioritizing-unconfirmed-transactions"><a class="header" href="#prioritizing-unconfirmed-transactions">Prioritizing Unconfirmed Transactions</a></h3>
<p>The maximum storage capacity used for storing unconfirmed transactions by the Mempool and each of its component pools 
can be configured. If a new transaction is received and the storage capacity limits have been reached, then 
transactions are prioritized according to the transaction priority metric. The transaction priority metric consist 
of the fees and the maturity of the UTXOs being spent by the transaction and should be applied to determine the priority 
of each transaction in the Mempool. As the allocated storage space of the Mempool becomes limited, the transactions 
with the highest priority are kept in the pool. The lowest priority transactions are discarded to make room for 
higher priority incoming transactions.</p>
<p>The transaction priority metric has the following behavior:</p>
<ul>
<li>Transactions spending UTXOs with higher block height maturity SHOULD be prioritized over transactions spending UTXOs 
with lower block height maturity.</li>
<li>Transactions with higher fees per transaction message size SHOULD be prioritized over lower fee transactions.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="syncing-and-updating-of-the-memory-pool-state"><a class="header" href="#syncing-and-updating-of-the-memory-pool-state">Syncing and Updating of the Memory Pool State</a></h3>
<p>On the initial startup of the Mempool, the complete state of the Mempool that consists of the Transaction Pool, Pending 
Pool, Orphan Pool and Reorg Pool can be requested and downloaded from the connected peers. A memory pool typically 
doesn't make use of persistent storage but could be configured to keep a backup of the last known state. If an existing 
Mempool state is locally available then a more efficient update process can be performed by requesting only the 
unconfirmed transactions missing from the current Mempool state. When no state is available then the entire Mempool 
state must be downloaded from the connected peers. During downloading or updating of the Mempool state, the validity 
of all transaction in the pool must be verified and the priority of each transaction must be calculated. </p>
<p>Functional behavior required for sharing and updating of the Mempool state, and propagation of transactions between peers:</p>
<ul>
<li>All verified transaction MUST be propagated to neighboring peers.</li>
<li>Duplicate transactions MUST NOT be propagated to peers.</li>
<li>Unvalidated or invalid transactions MUST NOT be propagated to peers.</li>
<li>Verified transactions that were discarded due to low priority levels MUST be propagated to peers.</li>
<li>The Mempool MUST have an interface that can be used by neighboring peers to query the content and state of the memory 
pool.</li>
<li>It MUST have a mechanism that enables peers to download the memory pool state in full or in part.</li>
<li>It MUST accept all transactions received from peers but MAY decide to discard low priority transactions.</li>
<li>It MUST allow wallets to track payments by monitoring that a particular transaction has been added to the Mempool.</li>
<li>A Mempool MAY choose:
<ul>
<li>to discard the Mempool state on restarts and then download the full state from its peers or</li>
<li>to store the state of the Mempool using persistent storage to reduce communication bandwidth required when 
reinitializing the Mempool after a restart.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="transaction-pool"><a class="header" href="#transaction-pool">Transaction Pool</a></h3>
<p>The Transaction Pool consists of all unconfirmed transactions that have been received, verified and have passed 
all checks. These unconfirmed transactions in the Transaction Pool are ready to be included and can be used to 
construct new blocks for the Tari blockchain.</p>
<p>Functional behavior required of the Transaction Pool:</p>
<ul>
<li>It MUST verify that incoming transactions only spend existing UTXOs.</li>
<li>It MUST ensure that incoming transactions don't have a processing time-lock or has a time-lock that has 
expired.</li>
<li>It MUST ensure that all time-locks of the UTXOs that will be spent by the transaction have expired.</li>
<li>Transactions that have been used to construct new blocks MUST be removed from the Transaction Pool and added to the Reorg Pool.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="pending-pool"><a class="header" href="#pending-pool">Pending Pool</a></h3>
<p>The Pending Pool contains all transactions that are restricted by time-locks. A transaction could have a time-lock 
limiting it from being processed or it can attempt to spend UTXOs with time-locks. These transactions require 
their time-locks or the time-locks of the input UTXOs to expire before they can be processed and included into new 
blocks. All transactions in the Pending Pool have been verified and passed all checks except their own time-lock has 
not yet expired or some of the UTXOs that will be spent have time-lock restrictions that are not yet valid. Once the 
transactions time-lock or the time-locks on the UTXOs have expired then the Pending Pool transactions can be moved 
to the Transaction Pool for inclusion in future blocks.</p>
<p>Functional behavior required of the Pending Pool:</p>
<ul>
<li>Once the transaction time-lock or UTXO time-lock restricting the processing of a transaction has expired then the 
pending transaction MUST be moved to the Transaction Pool.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="orphan-pool"><a class="header" href="#orphan-pool">Orphan Pool</a></h3>
<p>The Orphan Pool contains all the received transactions that have passed all the verification steps and checks, except 
they attempt to spend UTXOs that don't exist. A possible reason these UTXOs do not yet exist is that they may not yet 
have been created and might exist in the future. Typically, these orphaned transactions are from a series or bundle of 
transactions that need to be processed in a specific order but</p>
<ul>
<li>have been either received out of order,</li>
<li>or the order of processing the bundled transactions might not have been known or specified.</li>
</ul>
<p>As transactions are processed and the missing UTXOs have been created, then the orphaned transactions can be moved 
to the Transaction Pool for possible inclusion in future blocks. Another possibility why the input UTXOs might not 
be available is that the UTXOs were double spent by other transactions. In time, the double spent transactions will 
be discarded from the Orphan Pool once they have reached the appropriate maturity threshold.</p>
<p>Functional behavior required of the Orphan Pool:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each newly received transaction MUST be verified and pass all checks except the UTXO validity check before it is 
placed in the Orphan Pool.</li>
<li>Orphaned transactions must be upgraded and moved to the Transaction Pool once the previously unavailable UTXOs become 
available.</li>
<li>Orphaned transactions that have surpassed the expiration time threshold MUST be removed from the Orphan Pool.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="reorg-pool"><a class="header" href="#reorg-pool">Reorg Pool</a></h3>
<p>The Reorg Pool consists of all unconfirmed transaction that have recently been added to blocks, resulting in 
their removal from the Transaction Pool. When a potential blockchain reorganization occurs that invalidates previously 
assembled blocks, the transactions used to construct these discarded blocks can be recovered from the Reorg Pool and 
can be added back into the Transaction Pool. This will ensure that high priority transactions are not lost during 
blockchain reorganization but can be added into future blocks without retransmission of these transactions.</p>
<p>Functional behavior required of the Reorg Pool:</p>
<ul>
<li>Copies of the verified transactions removed from the Transaction pool that were placed in blocks MUST be stored in 
the Reorg Pool.</li>
<li>Transactions in the Reorg pool MAY be removed after the threshold expiration time has been reached. </li>
<li>When a blockchain reorganization is detected, all affected transactions from the Reorg Pool MUST be moved to the 
Transaction Pool.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="mempool-1"><a class="header" href="#mempool-1">Mempool</a></h3>
<p>The Mempool manages the four component pools and interacts with peers to share and retrieve transactions and 
the Mempool state. During the operation of the Mempool it will distribute incoming transactions to the appropriate 
component pools. When a new incoming transaction is received a number of checks and verification steps need to be performed 
to determine if the transaction can be added to the Mempool and determine which of the component pools should be responsible 
for that particular transaction. Only when the new transaction has passed these checks can it be added to the Mempool and 
should it be propagated to the connected peers.</p>
<p>Functional behavior required of the Mempool:</p>
<ul>
<li>If a duplicate transaction is received, that already exist in the Mempool, then the duplicate copy MUST be discarded.</li>
<li>When considering transactions that attempt to double spend UTXOs, the highest priority transaction MUST be kept and any 
other transactions that spend the same UTXO MUST be discarded.</li>
<li>When the storage limit of the Mempool has been reached, new incoming transactions SHOULD be prioritized according to the 
Priority metric.</li>
<li>Lower priority Mempool transactions MUST be discarded to make room for higher priority incoming transactions.</li>
<li>Incoming transactions with lower priorities than the minimum transaction priority in the Mempool MUST be discarded.</li>
<li>The Mempool MUST verify that incoming transactions do not have duplicate outputs.</li>
<li>It MUST check that all coinbase outputs that will be spent have matured sufficiently.</li>
<li>The distribution of storage space allocated to each component pool in the memory pool MAY be configured and adjusted.</li>
<li>The memory pool SHOULD have a mechanism to estimate fee categories from the current Mempool state. As an example, 
a priority fee can be estimated that will ensure that a new transactions will have the appropriate priority to be added 
into a new block in a timely manner.</li>
</ul>
<p>Functional behavior required for distributing incoming transactions to the component pools:</p>
<ul>
<li>Verified transactions that have passed all checks such as spending of valid UTXOs and expired time-locks MUST be 
placed in the Transaction Pool</li>
<li>All transactions that attempt to spend UTXOs with valid time-locks MUST be added to the Pending Pool.</li>
<li>Incoming transactions with time-locks prohibiting them from being included into new blocks should be added to the 
Pending Pool.</li>
<li>Newly received verified transaction attempting to spend a UTXO that does not yet exist MUST be added to the Orphan 
pool.</li>
<li>Transactions that have been added to blocks and were removed from the Transaction Pool should be added to the Reorg Pool.</li>

<h2 id="introduction"><a class="header" href="#introduction">Introduction</a></h2>
<p>It is hopefully clear to anyone reading these RFCs that the ambitions of the Tari project extend beyond a
Mimblewimble-clone-coin.
It should also be fairly clear that vanilla Mimblewimble does not have the feature set to provide functionality such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>One-sided payments</li>
<li>Multiparty side-chain peg outs and peg-ins</li>
<li>Generalised smart contracts</li>
</ul>
<p>Extensions to Mimblewimble have been proposed for most of these features, for example, David Burkett's one-sided payment
proposal for LiteCoin (<a href="https://github.com/DavidBurkett/lips/blob/master/lip-0004.mediawiki">LIP-004</a>), this project's <a href="RFC-0230_HTLC.html">HTLC RFC</a> and the pegging proposals for the
Clacks side-chain.</p>
<p>Some smart contract features are possible, or partly possible in vanilla Mimblewimble using <a href="https://tlu.tarilabs.com/cryptography/scriptless-scripts/introduction-to-scriptless-scripts.html">Scriptless script</a>, such as</p>
<ul>
<li>Atomic swaps </li>
<li>Hash time-locked contracts</li>
</ul>
<p>This RFC makes the case that if Tari were to implement a scripting language similar to Bitcoin script, then all of these
use cases will collapse and can be achieved under a single set of (relatively minor) modifications and additions to the
current Tari and Mimblewimble protocol.</p>
<h2 id="scripting-on-mimblewimble"><a class="header" href="#scripting-on-mimblewimble">Scripting on Mimblewimble</a></h2>
<p>To the author's knowledge, none of existing Mimblewimble projects have employed a scripting language, nor are there 
ambitions to do so. </p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/mimblewimble/grin">Grin</a> styles itself as a &quot;Minimal implementation of the Mimblewimble protocol&quot;,
so one might infer that this status is unlikely to change soon.</p>
<p>Beam <a href="https://github.com/BeamMW/beam/wiki/Beam-Smart-Contracts">recently announced</a> the inclusion of a smart contract
protocol, which allows users to execute arbitrary code (shaders) in a sandboxed Beam VM and have the results of that 
code interact with transactions.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/mwcproject/mwc-node/blob/master/doc/roadmap.md">Mimblewimble coin</a> is a fork of Grin and &quot;considers
the protocol ossified&quot;.</p>
<p>Litecoin is in the process of adding Mimblewimble as a
<a href="https://github.com/litecoin-project/lips/blob/master/lip-0003.mediawiki">side-chain</a>. As of this writing, there appear
to be no plans to include general scripting into the protocol.</p>
<h3 id="scriptless-scripts"><a class="header" href="#scriptless-scripts">Scriptless scripts</a></h3>
<p><a href="https://tlu.tarilabs.com/cryptography/scriptless-scripts/introduction-to-scriptless-scripts.html">Scriptless script</a> is a wonderfully elegant technology and inclusion of Tari script does not preclude the use of
Scriptless script in Tari. However, scriptless scripts have some disadvantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>They are often difficult to reason about, with the result that the development of features based on scriptless scripts
is essentially in the hands of a very select group of cryptographers and developers.</li>
<li>The use case set is impressive considering that the &quot;scripts&quot; are essentially signature wrangling, but is still 
somewhat limited.</li>
<li>Every feature must be written and implemented separately using the specific and specialised protocol designed for that
feature. That is, it cannot be used as a dynamic scripting framework on a running blockchain.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="tari-script---a-brief-motivation"><a class="header" href="#tari-script---a-brief-motivation">Tari script - a brief motivation</a></h2>
<p>The essential idea of Tari script is as follows:</p>
<p>Given a standard Tari UTXO, we add <em>additional restrictions</em> on whether that UTXO can be included as a valid input in a
transaction.</p>
<p>As long as those conditions are suitably committed to, are not malleable throughout the existence of the UTXO, and one
can prove that the script came from the UTXO owner, then these conditions are not that different to the 
requirement of having range proofs attached to UTXOs, which require that the value of Tari commitments is non-negative.</p>
<p>This argument is independent of the nature of the additional restrictions. Specifically, if these restrictions are
manifested as a script that provides additional constraints over whether a UTXO may be spent, the same arguments apply.</p>
<p>This means that in a very hand-wavy sort of way, there ought to be no reason that Tari Script is not workable.</p>
<p>Note that range proofs can be discarded after a UTXO is spent. This entails that the global security guarantees of
Mimblewimble are not that every transaction in history was valid from an inflation perspective, but that the net effect
of all transactions lead to zero spurious inflation. This sounds worse than it is, since locally, every individual
transaction is checked for validity at the time of inclusion in the blockchain.</p>
<p>If it somehow happened that two illegal transactions made it into the blockchain (perhaps due to a bug), and the two
cancelled each other out such that the global coin supply was still correct, one would never know this when doing a
chain synchronisation in pruned mode.</p>
<p>But if there was a steady inflation bug due to invalid range proofs making it into the blockchain, a pruned mode sync
would still detect that <em>something</em> was awry, because the global coin supply balance acts as another check.</p>
<p>With Tari script, once the script has been pruned away, and then there is a re-org to an earlier point on the chain,
then there's no way to ensure that the script was honoured unless you run an archival node.</p>
<p>This is broadly in keeping with the Mimblewimble security guarantees that, in pruned-mode synchronisation, individual 
transactions are not necessarily verified during chain synchronisation.</p>
<p>However, the guarantee that no additional coins are created or destroyed remains intact.</p>
<p>Put another way, the blockchain relies on the network <em>at the time</em> to enforce the Tari script spending rules. 
This means that the scheme may be susceptible to certain <em>horizon attacks</em>.</p>
<p>Incidentally, a single honest archival node would be able to detect any fraud on the same chain and provide a simple proof
that a transaction did not honour the redeem script.</p>
<h3 id="additional-requirements"><a class="header" href="#additional-requirements">Additional requirements</a></h3>
<p>The assumptions that broadly equate scripting with range proofs in the above argument are:</p>
<ul>
<li>The script (hash) must be committed to the blockchain.</li>
<li>The script must not be malleable in any way without invalidating the transaction. This restriction extends to all 
participants, including the UTXO owner.</li>
<li>We must be able to prove that the UTXO originator provides the script hash and no-one else.</li>
<li>The scripts and their redeeming inputs must be stored on the block chain. In particular, the input data must not be
malleable.</li>
</ul>
<p>The next section discusses the specific proposals for achieving these requirements.</p>
<h2 id="protocol-modifications"><a class="header" href="#protocol-modifications">Protocol modifications</a></h2>
<p>At a high level, Tari script works as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>A commitment to the spending script is recorded in the transaction UTXO.</li>
<li>UTXOs also define a new, <em>offset public key</em>.</li>
<li>After the script is executed, the execution stack must contain exactly one value that will be interpreted as a public key.
One can prove ownership of a UTXO by demonstrating knowledge of both the commitment blinding factor, <em>and</em> the script key.</li>
<li>The script key signs the script input data.</li>
<li>The offset and script keys are used in conjunction to create a <em>script offset</em>, which used in the consensus balance to prevent a
number of attacks.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="utxo-data-commitments"><a class="header" href="#utxo-data-commitments">UTXO data commitments</a></h3>
<p>The script, as well as other UTXO metadata, such as the output features are committed to in the range proof. As we will
describe later, the notion of a script offset is introduced to prevent cut-through and forces the preservation of these
commitments until they are recorded into the blockchain.</p>
<p>There are several changes to the protocol data structures that must be made to allow this scheme to work. </p>
<p>The first is a relatively minor adjustment to the transaction output definition.
The second is the inclusion of script input data and an additional public key in the transaction input field.
Third is the way we calculate and validate the range proof.</p>
<h3 id="transaction-output-changes"><a class="header" href="#transaction-output-changes">Transaction output changes</a></h3>
<p>The current definition of a Tari UTXO is:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">pub struct TransactionOutput {
    /// Options for an output's structure or use
    features: OutputFeatures,
    /// The homomorphic commitment representing the output amount
    commitment: Commitment,
    /// A proof that the commitment is in the right range
    proof: RangeProof,
}
</code></pre>
<p><em>Note:</em> Currently, the output features are actually malleable. TariScript fixes this.</p>
<p>Under TariScript, this definition changes to accommodate the script and the offset public keys:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">pub struct TransactionOutput {
    /// Options for an output's structure or use
    features: OutputFeatures,
    /// The homomorphic commitment representing the output amount
    commitment: Commitment,
    /// A proof that the commitment is in the right range
    proof: RangeProof,
    /// The serialised script
    script_hash: Vec&lt;u8&gt;,
    /// The offset pubkey, K_O
    offset_pub_key: PublicKey
}
</code></pre>
<p>We now introduce some <a href="RFC-0201_TariScript.html#notation">Notation</a>.</p>
<p>The commitment definition is unchanged:</p>
<p>$$
C_i = v_i \cdot H  + k_i \cdot G
$$</p>
<p>We update \( \rpc_i \), the range proof commitment, to be the hash of the script hash, output features and
offset public key as follows:</p>
<p>$$
\rpc_i = \hash{\scripthash_i \cat \mathrm{F_i} \cat K_{Oi}}
$$</p>
<p>Wallets now generate the range proof with</p>
<p>$$ k_i + \rpc_i $$</p>
<p>rather than just \( k_i \).</p>
<p>Note that:</p>
<ul>
<li>The UTXO has a positive value <code>v</code> like any normal UTXO. </li>
<li>The script and the output features can no longer be changed by the miner or any other party. Once mined, the owner can
also no longer change the script or output features without invalidating the range proof.</li>
<li>We don't provide the complete script on the output, just the script hash.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="transaction-input-changes"><a class="header" href="#transaction-input-changes">Transaction input changes</a></h3>
<p>The current definition of an input is</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">pub struct TransactionInput {
    /// The features of the output being spent. We will check maturity for all outputs.
    pub features: OutputFeatures,
    /// The commitment referencing the output being spent.
    pub commitment: Commitment,
}
</code></pre>
<p>In standard Mimblewimble, an input is the same as an output <em>sans</em> range proof. The range proof doesn't need to be checked
again when spending inputs, so it is dropped. </p>
<p>The updated input definition is:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">pub struct TransactionInput {
    /// Options for an output's structure or use
    features: OutputFeatures,
    /// The homomorphic commitment representing the output amount
    commitment: Commitment,
    
    /// The serialised script
    script: Vec&lt;u8&gt;,
    /// The script input data, if any
    input_data: Vec&lt;u8&gt;
    /// The block height that the UTXO was mined 
    height : u64
    /// A signature with k_s, signing the script, input data, and mined height
    script_signature: Signature,
    /// The offset pubkey, K_O
    offset_pubkey: PublicKey
}
</code></pre>
<p>The input data to the script is signed with resolving script public key \(K_s \), which proves that the spender provides
the input to the script.</p>
<p>The <code>height</code> field is the height this UTXO was mined at. This is to stop <a href="RFC-0201_TariScript.html#replay-attacks">Replay attacks</a>.</p>
<p>The <code>script_signature</code> is a Schnorr signature. It signs the script, the script input, and the height the UTXO was originally mined:</p>
<p>$$
s_{Si} = r_{Si} + \hash{ R_{Si} \cat \alpha_i \cat \input_i \cat h_i} k_{Si}
$$ </p>
<h3 id="consensus-changes"><a class="header" href="#consensus-changes">Consensus changes</a></h3>
<p>The Mimblewimble balance for blocks and transactions stays the same.</p>
<p>The range proof commits all the values comprising the transaction output. So now instead of verifying the range proof
using the standard output commitment, \( C_i \), we use the modified commitment,</p>
<p>$$ \hat{C_i} = v_i\cdot H  + \bigl( k_i + \rpc_i \bigr) \cdot G  $$</p>
<p>We can then verify the range proof. If the range proof is valid, we know that the value v, is positive and that none of
the values have been changed.</p>
<p>The new offset pubkey, \(K_O \),  and the script public key, \(K_S \), are combined to create a script offset,
\( \so \).</p>
<p>\( \so\) is calculated and verified as part of every block and transaction validation. This is calculated as follows:</p>
<p>$$
\so = \sum_i\mathrm{k_{Si}} - \sum_j(\mathrm{k_{Oj}  \HU_j}) \; \text{for each input}, i,\, \text{and each output}, j
$$</p>
<p>where \(  \HU_i \)  is the serialized hash of the entire output <em>sans</em> the range proof.</p>
<p>Usually, the spenders will know and provide the  \( k_{Oi} \), and the new UTXO owners (receivers) will provide the
\( k_{Sj} \), but this is not necessarily always the case (see the <a href="RFC-0201_TariScript.html#examples">Examples</a>).</p>
<p>For every block and/or transactions, an accompanying \( \so \) needs to be provided.</p>
<p>Currently, Tari, like vanilla Mimblewimble, has a transaction offset in each transaction instance, and an aggregate offset
stored in the header of the block. To accommodate the <em>script offset</em> we need to add a <code>script_offset</code> to transactions,
and an aggregated <code>total_script_offset</code> to the header.</p>
<p>We modify the transactions to be:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">pub struct Transaction {
    
    ...
    
    /// A scalar offset that links outputs and inputs to prevent cut-through, enforcing the correct application of
    /// the output script.
    pub script_offset: BlindingFactor,
}
</code></pre>
<p>And Blockheaders need to be modified to:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">pub struct BlockHeader {
    
    ...
    
    /// Sum of script offsets for all kernels in this block.
    pub total_script_offset: BlindingFactor,
}
</code></pre>
<p>In addition to the changes given above, there are consensus rule changes for transaction and block validation.</p>
<p>For every valid block or transaction,</p>
<ol>
<li>Validate range proofs against \( \hat{C_i} \) rather than \( C_i \).</li>
<li>Check that the script signature, \( s_{Si} \) is valid for every input.</li>
<li>The script offset is valid for every block and transaction.</li>
<li>The script executes successfully using the given input script data.</li>
<li>The result of the script is a valid public key, \( K_S \).</li>
<li>The script signature, \( s_S \), is a valid signature for \( K_S \) and message \( \hash{ R_S \cat \script \cat \input \cat h } \).</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="examples"><a class="header" href="#examples">Examples</a></h2>
<p>Let's cover a few examples to illustrate the new scheme and provide justification for the additional requirements and
validation steps.</p>
<h3 id="standard-mw-transaction"><a class="header" href="#standard-mw-transaction">Standard MW transaction</a></h3>
<p>For this use case we have Alice who sends Bob some Tari.
Bob's wallet is  online and is able to countersign the transaction.</p>
<p>Alice creates a new transaction spending \( C_a \) to a new output \( C_b \) (ignoring fees for now).</p>
<p>To spend \( C_a \), she provides</p>
<ul>
<li>A script, \( \alpha_a \) such that the script hash, \( \scripthash_a = \hash{ \alpha_a }\) matches the blockchain
record for the UTXO containing \( C_a \).</li>
<li>The script input, \( \input_a \).</li>
<li>The height, \( h \), that the UTXO matching \( C_a \) was mined.</li>
<li>A valid signature, \( (s_{Sa}, R_{Sa}) \) proving that she knows the private key, \( k_{Sa} \), corresponding to
\( K_{Sa} \), the public key left on the stack after executing \( \script_a \) with \( \input_a \).</li>
<li>An offset public key, \( k_{Ob} \).</li>
</ul>
<p>Since Bob will be countersigning the transaction, Alice can essentially construct a traditional MW output for Bob:</p>
<p>She creates a new proto-output:</p>
<ul>
<li>with the value <em>v</em>; Bob will provide the blinding factor (as per vanilla Mimblewimble),</li>
<li>her public nonce, \( R_a \) for the excess signature (also as per vanilla Mimblewimble),</li>
<li>and the hash of a <code>NO_OP</code> script (See <a href="RFC-0202_TariScriptOpcodes.html">RFC 202</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p>Alice sends Bob this proto-UTXO, along with her signature nonce, as per the standard Mimblewimble protocol. However, she
also provides Bob with \( K_{Ob} \), the script offset public key.</p>
<p>Bob can then complete his side of the transaction by completing the output:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Calculating the commitment, \( C_b = k_b \cdot G + v \cdot H \),</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Choosing a private script key, \( k_{Sb} \),</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Creating a range proof for \( \hat{C}_b = (k_b + \rpc_b) \cdot G + v \cdot H \), with</p>
<p>$$
\rpc_b = \hash{\scripthash_b \cat F_b \cat K_{Ob} }
$$</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Bob then signs the kernel excess as usual:
$$
s_b = r_b + k_b \hash{R_a + R_b \cat f \cat m }
$$</p>
<p>Bob returns the UTXO and partial signature along with his nonce, \( R_b \), back to Alice.</p>
<p>Alice will then complete the transaction by calculating the script offset, \( \so\):
$$
\so  = k_{Sa} - k_{Ob} \HU_b
$$</p>
<p>She can then construct and broadcast the transaction to the network.</p>
<h4 id="transaction-validation"><a class="header" href="#transaction-validation">Transaction validation</a></h4>
<p>Base nodes validate the transaction as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>They check that the usual Mimblewimble balance holds by summing inputs and outputs and validating against the excess
signature. This check does not change. Nor do the other validation rules, such as confirming that all inputs are in
the UTXO set etc.</li>
<li>The range proof of Bob's output is validated with \( \hat{C}_b \) rather than \( C_b \),</li>
<li>The script signature on Alice's input is validated against the script, input and mining height,</li>
<li>The script hash must match the hash of the provided input script,</li>
<li>The input script must execute successfully using the provided input data; and the script result must be a valid public key,
\( K_{Sa} \).</li>
<li>The script offset is verified by checking that the balance
$$
\so \cdot{G} = K_{Sa} - \HU_b K_{Ob}
$$
holds.</li>
</ul>
<p>When the transaction is included in a block, the total offset for the block is validated, in an analogous fashion to how
the excess offset is used.</p>
<p>Finally, when Bob spends this output, he will use \( K_{Sb} \) as his script input and sign it with his private key
\( k_{Sb} \). He will choose a new \( K_{Oc} \) to give to the recipient, and he will construct the script offset,
\( \so_b \) as follows:</p>
<p>$$
\so_b = k_{Sb} - k_{Oc} \HU_b
$$</p>
<h3 id="one-sided-payment"><a class="header" href="#one-sided-payment">One sided payment</a></h3>
<p>In this example, Alice pays Bob, who is not available to countersign the transaction, so Alice initiates a one-sided payment,</p>
<p>$$
C_a \Rightarrow  C_b
$$</p>
<p>Once again, transaction fees are ignored to simplify the illustration.</p>
<p>Alice owns \( C_a \) and provides the required script to spend the UTXO as was described in the previous cases.</p>
<p>Alice needs a public key from Bob, \( K_{Sb} \) to complete the one-sided transaction. This key can be obtained
out-of-bound, and will typically be Bob's wallet public key on the Tari network.</p>
<p>Alice uses Bob's public key to create a shared secret, \( k_b \) for the output commitment, \( C_b \), using
Diffie-Hellman key exchange.</p>
<p>Alice knows the script-redeeming private key \( k_{Sa}\) for the transaction input.</p>
<p>Alice will create the entire transaction including, generating a new offset keypair and calculating the script offset,</p>
<p>$$
\so = k_{Sa} - k_{Ob} \cdot \HU_b
$$</p>
<p>For the script hash, she provides the hash of a script that locks the output to Bob's public key, <code>PushPubkey(K_Sb)</code>.
This script will only resolve successfully if the spender can provide a valid signature as input that demonstrates proof
of knowledge of \( k_{Sb} \) which only Bob knows.</p>
<p>Any base node can now verify that the transaction is complete, verify the signature on the script, and verify the script
offset.</p>
<p>For Bob to claim his commitment, \( C_b \) he requires the blinding factor, \( k_b \), and his private key for the script.</p>
<p>In this case, the script hash is analogous to an address in Bitcoin or Monero. Bob's wallet can scan the blockchain
looking for hashes that he would know how to resolve. For all outputs that he discovers this way, Bob would need to know
who the sender is so that he can derive the shared secret.  This information can be obtained without needing to communicate
with the sender, if she uses the offset public key, \( K_{Ob} \) as the key in deriving the Diffie-Hellman exchange.</p>
<p>For Bob's part, when he discovers one-sided payments to himself, he should spend them to new outputs using a traditional
transaction to thwart any potential horizon attacks in the future.</p>
<p>To summarise, the information required for one-sided transactions is as follows:</p>

<h3 id="htlc-like-script"><a class="header" href="#htlc-like-script">HTLC-like script</a></h3>
<p>In this use case we have a script that controls where it can be spent. The script is out of scope for this example, but
has applies the following rules:</p>
<ul>
<li>Alice can spend the UTXO unilaterally after block <em>n</em>, <strong>or</strong></li>
<li>Alice and Bob can spend it together.</li>
</ul>
<p>This would be typically what a lightning-type channel requires.</p>
<p>Alice owns the commitment \( C_a \).
She and Bob work together to create \( C_s\).
But we don't yet know who can spend the newly created \( C_s\) and under what conditions this will be.</p>
<p>$$
C_a \Rightarrow  C_s \Rightarrow  C_x
$$</p>
<p>Alice owns \( C_a\), so she knows the blinding factor \( k_a\) and the correct input for the script's spending conditions.
Alice also generates the offset keypair, \( (k_{Os}, K_{Os} )\).</p>
<p>Now Alice and Bob proceed with the standard transaction flow.</p>
<p>Alice and Bob have to ensure that \( K_{Os}\) is inside of the commitment \( C_s\).
Alice will fill in the script with her \( k_{Sa}\) to unlock the commitment \( C_a\).
Because Alice owns \( C_a\) she needs to construct \( \so\) with:</p>
<p>$$
\so = k_{Sa} - k_{Ob} \cdot \HU_s
$$</p>
<p>The blinding factor, \( k_s\) can be generated using a Diffie-Hellman construction.
The commitment \( C_s\) needs to be constructed with the script the Bob agrees on. Until it is mined, Alice could modify
the script via double-spend and thus Bob must wait until the transaction is confirmed before accepting the conditions of
the smart contract between Alice and himself.</p>
<p>Once the UTXO is mined, both Alice and Bob possess all the knowledge required to spend the \( C_s \) UTXO. It's only
the conditions of the script that will discriminate between the two.</p>
<p>The spending case of either Alice or Bob claiming the commitment \( C_s\) follows the same flow described in the previous examples, with
the spender proving knowledge of \( k_{Ss}\) and &quot;unlocking&quot; the spending script.</p>
<p>The case of Alice and Bob spending \( C_s \) together to a new multiparty commitment requires some elaboration.</p>
<p>Assume that Alice and Bob want to spend  \( C_s \) co-operatively.
This involves the script being executed in such a way that the resulting public key on the stack is the sum of Alice and
Bob's individual script keys, \( k_{SsA} \) and \( k_{SaB} \).</p>
<p>The script input needs to be signed by this aggregate key, and so Alice and Bob must each supply a partial signature following
the usual Schnorr aggregate mechanics.</p>
<p>In an analogous fashion, Alice and Bob also generate an aggregate \( k_{Ox}\) from their own \( k_{Ox}\)s.</p>
<p>To be specific, Alice calculates her portion from</p>
<p>$$
\so_A = k_{SsA} - k_{OxA} \cdot \HU_x
$$</p>
<p>Bob will construct his part of the \( \so\) with:
$$
\so_B = k_{SsB} - k_{OxB} \cdot \HU_x
$$</p>
<p>And the aggregate \( \so\) is then:</p>
<p>$$
\so = \so_A + \so_B
$$</p>
<p>Notice that in this case, both \( K_{Ss} \) and \( K_{Ox}\) are aggregate keys.</p>
<p>Notice also that because the script resolves to an aggregate key \( K_s\) neither Alice nor Bob can claim the
commitment \( C_s\) without the other party's key. If either party tries to cheat by editing the input, the script
validation will fail.</p>
<p>If either party tries to cheat by creating a new output, the offset will not validate correctly as the offset locks the
output of the transaction.</p>
<p>A base node validating the transaction will also not be able to tell this is an aggregate transaction as all keys are
aggregated Schnorr signatures. But it will be able to validate that the script input is correctly signed, thus the
output public key is correct and that the \( \so\) is correctly calculated, meaning that the commitment \( C_x\) is
the correct UTXO for the transaction.</p>

<h3 id="cut-through"><a class="header" href="#cut-through">Cut-through</a></h3>
<p>A major issue with many Mimblewimble extension schemes is that miners are able to cut-through UTXOs if an output is spent
in the same block it was created. This makes it so that the intervening UTXO never existed; along with any checks and
balances carried in that UTXO. It's also impossible to prove without additional information that cut-through even occurred
(though one may suspect, since the &quot;one&quot; transaction would contribute two kernels to the block).</p>
<p>In particular, cut-through is devastating for an idea like TariScript which relies on conditions present in the UTXO being
enforced.</p>
<p>This is the reason for the presence of the script offset in the TariScript proposal. It links a UTXO to the input(s)
that created it, and providing the script offset requires knowledge of keys that miners do not possess; thus they are unable
to produce the necessary script offset when attempting to perform cut-through on a pair of transactions.</p>
<p>Cut-through is still possible if the original owner participates. For example Alice, pays Bob, who pays Carol.
Cut-through can happen only if Alice and Carol negotiate a new transaction.</p>
<p>This will ensure that the original owner is happy with the spending the transaction to a new party, e.g. she has verified
the spending conditions like a script.</p>
<h3 id="script-lock-key-generation"><a class="header" href="#script-lock-key-generation">Script lock key generation</a></h3>
<p>At face value, it looks like the burden for wallets has tripled, since each UTXO owner has to remember three private keys,
the spend key, \( k_i \), the offset key \( k_{O} \) and the script key \( k_{S} \). In practice, the script key will
often be a static key associated with the user's node or wallet. Even if it is not, the script and offset keys
can be deterministically derived from the spend key. For example, \( k_{S} \) could be  \( \hash{ k_i \cat \alpha} \).</p>
<h3 id="replay-attacks-1"><a class="header" href="#replay-attacks-1">Replay attacks</a></h3>
<p>With a lot of these schemes it is possible to perform replay attacks. Look at the following scenario. We have Alice, Bob
and Carol. Assume Bob is a merchant, and Alice buys some stuff from Bob. Later, Bob pays Carol with the output he got from Alice:</p>
<p>$$
C_a \Rightarrow  C_b \Rightarrow  C_c
$$</p>
<p>This is all fine and secure. But let's say at a later stage, Alice pays Bob again, but Alice uses the
<em>exact same commitment, script and public keys</em> to pay Bob:</p>
<p>$$
C_a' \Rightarrow  C_b'
$$</p>
<p>After Bob ships his goods to Alice, Carol can just take the commitment \( C_b' \) because \( C_b == C_b' \) and she
already has a transaction with all the correct signatures to claim \( C_b \).</p>
<p>To ensure that a script is only valid once, we need to sign the block height that the original UTXO was mined at.
So going back to the case of:</p>
<p>$$
C_b \Rightarrow  C_c
$$</p>
<p>Bob would have signed that \( C_b \) was mined at block \( h \). This means that when Carol tries to publish a transaction for:</p>
<p>$$
C_b' \Rightarrow  C_c'
$$</p>
<p>she would need to sign the input of the script with the block height \( h' \) was mined at. However, the signature she
is trying to re-use is one for block <em>h</em> and her attack is foiled.</p>
<h3 id="blockchain-bloat"><a class="header" href="#blockchain-bloat">Blockchain bloat</a></h3>
<p>The most obvious drawback to TariScript is the effect it will have on blockchain size. UTXOs are substantially larger,
with the addition of the script, script signature, and a public key to every output.</p>
<p>These can eventually be pruned, but will increase storage and bandwidth requirements.</p>
<p>Input size in a block will now be much bigger as each input was previously just a commitment and an output features.
Each input now includes a script, input_data, the script signature and an extra public key. This could be compacted by
just broadcasting input hashes along with the missing script input data and signature, instead of the full input in
transaction messages, but this will still be larger than inputs are currently.</p>
<p>Every header will also be bigger as it includes an extra blinding factor that will not be pruned away.</p>
<p>The additional range proof validations and signature checks significantly hurt performance. Range proof checks are particularly
expensive. To improve overall block validation, batch range proof validations should be employed to mitigate this expense.</p>
<h3 id="fodder-for-chain-analysis"><a class="header" href="#fodder-for-chain-analysis">Fodder for chain analysis</a></h3>
<p>Another potential drawback of TariScript is the additional information that is handed to entities wishing to perform chain
analysis. Having scripts attached to outputs will often clearly mark the purpose of that UTXO. Users may wish to re-spend
outputs into vanilla, default UTXOs in a mixing transaction to disassociate Tari funds from a particular script.</p>
<h2 id="notation"><a class="header" href="#notation">Notation</a></h2>
<p>Where possible, the &quot;usual&quot; notation is used to denote terms commonly found in cryptocurrency literature. New terms introduced by Tariscript are assigned greek lowercase letters in most cases.<br />
The capital letter subscripts, <em>R</em> and <em>S</em> refer to a UTXO <em>receiver</em> and <em>script</em> respectively.</p>

<h3 id="covenants"><a class="header" href="#covenants">Covenants</a></h3>
<p>Tari script places restrictions on <em>who</em> can spend UTXOs. It will also be useful for Tari digital asset applications to
restrict <em>how</em> or <em>where</em> UTXOs may be spent in some cases. The general term for these sorts of restrictions are termed
<em>covenants</em>. The <a href="https://handshake.org/files/handshake.txt">Handshake white paper</a> has a fairly good description of how covenants work.</p>
<p>It is beyond the scope of this RFC, but it's anticipated that Tari Script would play a key role in the introduction of
generalised covenant support into Tari.</p>
<h3 id="lock-time-malleability"><a class="header" href="#lock-time-malleability">Lock-time malleability</a></h3>
<p>The current Tari protocol has an issue with Transaction Output Maturity malleability. This output feature is enforced in
the consensus rules, but it is actually possible for a miner to change the value without invalidating the transaction.</p>
<p>With TariScript, output features are properly committed to in the transaction and verified as part of the script offset
validation.</p>

<h2 id="tari-script-semantics"><a class="header" href="#tari-script-semantics">Tari Script semantics</a></h2>
<p>The proposal for TariScript is straightforward. It is based on Bitcoin script and inherits most of its ideas.</p>
<p>The main properties of Tari script are</p>
<ul>
<li>The scripting language is stack-based. At redeem time, the UTXO spender must supply an input stack. The script runs by
operating on the stack contents.</li>
<li>If an error occurs during execution, the script fails.</li>
<li>After the script completes, it is successful if and only if it has not aborted, and there is exactly a single element
on the stack. The script fails if the stack is empty, or contains more than one element, or aborts early.</li>
<li>It is not Turing complete, so there are no loops or timing functions.</li>
<li>The opcodes enforce type safety. e.g. A public key cannot be added to an integer scalar. Errors of this kind MUST cause
the script to fail. The Rust implementation of Tari Script automatically applies the type safety rules.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="failure-modes"><a class="header" href="#failure-modes">Failure modes</a></h3>
<p>Bitcoin transactions can &quot;fail&quot; in two main ways: Either there is a genuine error in the locking or unlocking script;
or a wallet broadcasts a <em><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fbloc.2019.00007/full">Non-standard transaction</a></em> to a non-mining node. To be more precise, Bitcoin core nodes
only accept a small subset of valid transaction scripts that are deemed <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/mastering-bitcoin/9781491902639/ch05.html">Standard transactions</a>. To succesfully produce
a non-standard Bitcoin transaction, one has to submit it directly to a miner that accepts non-standard transactions.</p>
<p>It's interesting to note that only 0.02% of transactions
mined in Bitcoin before block 550,000 were non-standard, and it appears that the vast majority of these were in fact
unintentional, leading to loss of funds <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fbloc.2019.00007/full">(1)</a>.</p>
<p>The present RFC proposes that TariScript not identify a subset of transactions as &quot;standard&quot;. However, some transactions
might be invalid in and of- themselves (e.g. invalid signature, invalid script), while others may be invalid because of
the execution context (e.g. a lock time has not expired).</p>
<p>All Tari nodes MUST reject the former type of invalid transaction; and SHOULD reject the latter. In these instances, it
is the <em>wallets'</em> responsibility to wait until transactions are valid before broadcasting them.</p>
<p>Rejected transactions are simply silently dropped.</p>
<p>This policy discourages spamming on the network and promotes responsible behaviour by wallets.</p>
<p>The full list of <a href="RFC-0202_TariScriptOpcodes.html#error-codes">Error codes</a> is given below.</p>
<h3 id="constraints"><a class="header" href="#constraints">Constraints</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>The maximum length of a script when serialised is 1,024 bytes.</li>
<li>The maximum length of a script's input is 1,024 bytes.</li>
<li>The maximum stack height is 255.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="opcodes"><a class="header" href="#opcodes">Opcodes</a></h2>
<p>Tari Script opcodes range from 0 to 255 and are represented as a single unsigned byte. The opcode set is
limited to allow for the applications specified in this RFC, but can be expanded in the future.</p>
<h3 id="block-height-checks"><a class="header" href="#block-height-checks">Block height checks</a></h3>
<p>All these opcodes test the current block height (or, if running the script as part of a transaction
validation, the next earliest block height) against a given value.</p>
<h5 id="checkheightverifyheight"><a class="header" href="#checkheightverifyheight">CheckHeightVerify(height)</a></h5>
<p>Compare the current block height to <code>height</code>.</p>
<p>Fails with <code>VERIFY_FAILED</code> if the block height &lt; <code>height</code>.</p>
<h5 id="checkheightheight"><a class="header" href="#checkheightheight">CheckHeight(height)</a></h5>
<p>Pushes the value of (the current height - <code>height</code>) to the stack. In other words,
the top of the stack will hold the height difference between <code>height</code> and the current height. If the chain has
progressed beyond height, the value is positive; and negative if the chain has yet to reach <code>height</code>.</p>
<p>Fails with <code>STACK_OVERFLOW</code> if the stack would exceed the max stack height.</p>
<h5 id="compareheightverify"><a class="header" href="#compareheightverify">CompareHeightVerify</a></h5>
<p>The same as <a href="RFC-0202_TariScriptOpcodes.html#checkheightverifyheight"><code>CheckHeightVerify</code></a>, except that the height to compare against the block height
is popped off the stack instead of being hardcoded in the script. Pops the top of the stack as <code>height</code> and compares
it to the current block height.</p>
<ul>
<li>Fails with <code>INVALID_INPUT</code> if there is not a valid integer value on top of the stack.</li>
<li>Fails with <code>EMPTY_STACK</code> if the stack is empty.</li>
<li>Fails with <code>VERIFY_FAILED</code> if the block height &lt; <code>height</code>.</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="compareheight"><a class="header" href="#compareheight">CompareHeight</a></h5>
<p>The same as <a href="RFC-0202_TariScriptOpcodes.html#checkheightheight"><code>CompareHeight</code></a> except that the height to compare against the block height
is popped off the stack instead of being hardcoded in the script.</p>
<p>Pops the top of the stack as <code>height</code>, then pushes the value of (<code>height</code> - the current height) to the stack.
In other words, this opcode replaces the top of the stack with the difference between that value and the current height.</p>
<ul>
<li>Fails with <code>INVALID_INPUT</code> if there is not a valid integer value on top of the stack.</li>

<h2 id="serialisation"><a class="header" href="#serialisation">Serialisation</a></h2>
<p>Tari Script and the execution stack are serialised into byte strings using a simple linear parser. Since all opcodes are
a single byte, it's very easy to read and write script byte strings. If an opcode has a parameter associated with it,
e.g. <code>PushHash</code> then it is equally known how many bytes following the opcode will contain the parameter.</p>
<p>The script input data is serialised in an analogous manner. The first byte in a stream indicates the type of data in the
bytes that follow. The length of each type is fixed and known <em>a priori</em>. The next <em>n</em> bytes read represent the data type.</p>
<p>As input data elements are read in, they are pushed onto the stack. This means that the <em>last</em> input element will typically
be operated on <em>first</em>!</p>
<p>The types of input parameters that are accepted are:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th align="left">Type</th><th align="left">Range / Value</th></tr></thead><tbody>

<h3 id="anyone-can-spend"><a class="header" href="#anyone-can-spend">Anyone can spend</a></h3>
<p>The simplest script is an empty script, or a script with a single <code>NoOp</code> opcode. When faced with this script, the spender
can supply any pubkey in her script input for which she knows the private key. The script will execute, leaving that
public key as the result, and the transaction script validation will pass.</p>
<h3 id="one-sided-transactions"><a class="header" href="#one-sided-transactions">One-sided transactions</a></h3>
<p>One-sided transactions lock the input to a predetermined public key provided by the recipient; essentially the same
method that Bitcoin uses. The simplest form of this is to simply post the new owner's public key as the script:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">PushPubkey(P_B)
</code></pre>
<p>To spend this output, Bob provides an empty input stack. After execution, the stack contains his public key.</p>
<p>An equivalent script to Bitcoin's P2PKH would be:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">Dup HashBlake256 PushHash(PKH) EqualVerify
</code></pre>
<p>To spend this, Bob provides his public key as script input.
To illustrate the execution process, we show the script running on the left, and resulting stack on the right:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th align="left">Initial script</th><th align="left">Initial Stack</th></tr></thead><tbody>

<p>The script has completed without errors, and Bob's public key remains on the stack.</p>
<h3 id="hash-time-lock-contract"><a class="header" href="#hash-time-lock-contract">Hash time-lock contract</a></h3>
<p>Alice sends some Tari to Bob. If he doesn't spend it within a certain timeframe (up till block 4000), then she is also
able to spend it back to herself.</p>
<p>The spender provides their public key as input to the script.</p>

<p>Let's run through this script assuming it's block 3990 and Bob is spending the UTXO. We'll only print the stack this
time:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th align="left">Initial Stack</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td align="left">Bob's pubkey</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p><code>Dup</code>:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th align="left">Stack</th></tr></thead><tbody>

</tbody></table>
<p><code>PushPubkey(P_b)</code>:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th align="left">Stack</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td align="left"><code>P_b</code></td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Bob's pubkey</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Bob's pubkey</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p><code>CheckHeight(4000)</code>. The block height is 3990, so <code>3990 - 4000</code> is pushed to the stack:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th align="left">Stack</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td align="left">-10</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left"><code>P_b</code></td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Bob's pubkey</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Bob's pubkey</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p><code>GeZero</code> pushes a 1 if the top stack element is positive or zero:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th align="left">Stack</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td align="left">0</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left"><code>P_b</code></td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Bob's pubkey</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Bob's pubkey</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p><code>IFTHEN</code> compares the top of the stack to 1. It is not a match, so it will execute the <code>ELSE</code> branch:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th align="left">Stack</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td align="left"><code>P_b</code></td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Bob's pubkey</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Bob's pubkey</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p><code>EqualVerify</code> checks that <code>P_b</code> is equal to Bob's pubkey:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th align="left">Stack</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td align="left">Bob's pubkey</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>The <code>ENDIF</code> is a no-op, so the stack contains Bob's public key, meaning Bob must sign to spend this transaction.</p>
<p>Similarly, if it is after block 4000, say block 4005, and Alice or Bob tries to spend the UTXO, the sequence is:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th align="left">Initial Stack</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td align="left">Alice or Bob's pubkey</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p><code>Dup</code> and <code>PushPubkey(P_b)</code> as before:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th align="left">Stack</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td align="left"><code>P_b</code></td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Alice or Bob's pubkey</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Alice or Bob's pubkey</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p><code>CheckHeight(4000)</code> calculates <code>4005 - 4000)</code> and pushes 5 to the stack:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th align="left">Stack</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td align="left">5</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left"><code>P_b</code></td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Alice or Bob's pubkey</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Alice or Bob's pubkey</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p><code>GeZero</code> pops the 5 and pushes a 1 to the stack:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th align="left">Stack</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td align="left">1</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left"><code>P_b</code></td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Alice or Bob's pubkey</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Alice or Bob's pubkey</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>The top of the stack is 1, so <code>IFTHEN</code> executes the first branch, <code>PushPubkey(P_a)</code>:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th align="left">Stack</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td align="left"><code>P_a</code></td></tr>
<tr><td align="left"><code>P_b</code></td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Alice or Bob's pubkey</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Alice or Bob's pubkey</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p><code>OrVerify(2)</code> compares the 3rd element, Alice's pubkey, with the 2 top items that were popped. There is a match, so the script
continues.</p>
<table><thead><tr><th align="left">Stack</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td align="left">Alice or Bob's pubkey</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>If the script executes successfully, then either Alice's or Bob's public key is left on the stack, meaning only Alice
or Bob can spend the output.</p>

<p>The aim of this Request for Comment (RFC) is to describe a few extensions to <a href="Glossary.html#mimblewimble">Mimblewimble</a> to allow time-related transactions.</p>

<h4 id="time-locked-contracts"><a class="header" href="#time-locked-contracts">Time-locked Contracts</a></h4>
<p>In <a href="Glossary.html#mimblewimble">Mimblewimble</a>, time-locked contracts can be accomplished by modifying the kernel of each transaction to include a
block height. This limits how early in the blockchain lifetime the specific transaction can be included in a block.</p>
<p>This means that users constructing a transaction:</p>
<ul>
<li>MUST include a lock height in the kernel of their transaction; and</li>
<li>MUST include the lock height in the transaction signature to prevent lock height malleability.</li>
</ul>
<p>Tari <a href="Glossary.html#base-node">base node</a>s MUST NOT add any transaction to the mined <a href="Glossary.html#block">block</a> that has not already exceeded its lock height.</p>
<p>This also adds the following requirement to a <a href="Glossary.html#base-node">base node</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>It MUST reject any <a href="Glossary.html#block">block</a> that contains a kernel with a lock height greater than the <a href="Glossary.html#current-head">current head</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="time-locked-utxos"><a class="header" href="#time-locked-utxos">Time-locked UTXOs</a></h4>
<p>Time-locked Unspent Transaction Outputs (UTXOs) can be accomplished by adding a feature flag to a UTXO and a lock height. 
This allows a limit on when in the blockchain lifetime the specific UTXO can be spent.</p>
<p>This requires that users constructing a transaction:</p>
<ul>
<li>MUST include a feature flag of their UTXO; and</li>
<li>MUST include a lock height in their UTXO.</li>
</ul>
<p>This adds the following requirement for a <a href="Glossary.html#base-node">base node</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <a href="Glossary.html#base-node">base node</a> MUST NOT allow a UTXO to be spent if the <a href="Glossary.html#current-head">current head</a> has not already exceeded the UTXO's lock height.</li>
</ul>
<p>This also adds the following requirement for a <a href="Glossary.html#base-node">base node</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>A base node MUST reject any <a href="Glossary.html#block">block</a> that contains a <a href="Glossary.html#unspent-transaction-outputs">UTXO</a> with a lock height not already past the <a href="Glossary.html#current-head">current head</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="hashed-time-locked-contract"><a class="header" href="#hashed-time-locked-contract">Hashed Time-locked Contract</a></h4>
<p>Hashed time-locked contracts are a way of reserving funds for a certain payment, but they only pay out to the receiver if
certain conditions are met. If these conditions are not met within a time limit, the funds are paid back to the sender.</p>
<p>Unlike Bitcoin, where this can be accomplished with a single transaction, in <a href="Glossary.html#mimblewimble">Mimblewimble</a>, HTLCs involve a multi-step
process to construct a time-locked contract.</p>
<p>The steps are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>The sender MUST pay all the funds into an n-of-n <a href="Glossary.html#multisig">multisig</a> <a href="Glossary.html#unspent-transaction-outputs">UTXO</a>.</li>
<li>All parties involved MUST construct a refund <a href="Glossary.html#transaction">transaction</a> to pay back all funds to the sender who has spent this n-of-n
<a href="Glossary.html#multisig">multisig</a> <a href="Glossary.html#unspent-transaction-outputs">UTXO</a>. However, this <a href="Glossary.html#transaction">transaction</a> has a transaction lock height set in
the future and cannot be mined immediately. It therefore lives in the <a href="Glossary.html#mempool">mempool</a>. This means that if anything goes
wrong from here on, the sender will get their money back after the time lock expires.</li>
<li>The sender MUST publish both above <a href="Glossary.html#transaction">transaction</a>s at the same time to ensure the receiver cannot hold the sender hostage.</li>
<li>The parties MUST construct a third <a href="Glossary.html#transaction">transaction</a> that pays the receiver the funds. This <a href="Glossary.html#transaction">transaction</a> typically makes
use of a preimage to allow spending of the <a href="Glossary.html#transaction">transaction</a> if the user reveals some knowledge, allowing the user to
unlock the <a href="Glossary.html#unspent-transaction-outputs">UTXO</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>HTLCs in <a href="Glossary.html#mimblewimble">Mimblewimble</a> make use of double-spending of the n-of-n <a href="Glossary.html#multisig">multisig</a> <a href="Glossary.html#unspent-transaction-outputs">UTXO</a>. The
first valid published <a href="Glossary.html#transaction">transaction</a> can then be mined and claim the n-of-n <a href="Glossary.html#multisig">multisig</a>
<a href="Glossary.html#unspent-transaction-outputs">UTXO</a>.</p>
<p>An example of an <a href="Glossary.html#hashed-time-locked-contract">HTLC</a> in practice can be viewed at Tari University:</p>

<p>The aim of this Request for Comment (RFC) is to describe Validator Node (VN) registration. Registration accomplishes two goals:</p>
<ol>
<li>Provides a register of Validator Nodes with an authority (the Tari base layer).</li>
<li>Offers Sybil resistance against gaining probabilistic majority of any given publicly nominated VN committee.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="description-14"><a class="header" href="#description-14">Description</a></h2>
<p>VNs register themselves on the <a href="Glossary.html#base-layer">Base layer</a> using a special <a href="Glossary.html#transaction">transaction</a> type. The registration
<a href="Glossary.html#transaction">transaction</a> type requires the spending of a certain minimum amount of <a href="Glossary.html#tari-coin">Tari coin</a>, the (<a href="Glossary.html#registration-deposit">Registration Deposit</a>),
which has a time lock on the output for a minimum amount of time (<a href="Glossary.html#registration-term">Registration Term</a>), as well as some metadata, such as
the VN's public key.</p>
<p>The Node ID is calculated after registration to prevent mining of VN public keys that can be used to manipulate routing
on the Distributed Hash Table (DHT).</p>
<p>Once a VN's <a href="Glossary.html#registration-term">Registration Term</a> has expired, so will this specific VN registration. The Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO)
time lock will have elapsed so
the <a href="Glossary.html#registration-deposit">Registration Deposit</a> can be reclaimed and a new VN registration needs to be performed. This automatic
registration expiry will ensure that the VN registry stays up to date with active VN registrations, and inactive
registrations will naturally be removed.</p>
<p>Requiring nodes to register themselves serves two purposes:</p>
<ul>
<li>makes VN Sybil attacks expensive; and</li>
<li>provides an authoritative &quot;central-but-not-centralized&quot; registry of VNs from the base layer.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="node-id"><a class="header" href="#node-id">Node ID</a></h3>
<p>The VN ID can be calculated deterministically after the VN registration transaction is mined. This ensures
that VNs are randomly distributed over the DHT network.</p>
<p>VN IDs MUST be calculated as follows:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text"> NodeId = Hash( pk || h || kh )
</code></pre>
<p>Where</p>
<table><thead><tr><th align="left">Field</th><th align="left">Description</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td align="left">pk</td><td align="left">The VN's DHT public key</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">h</td><td align="left">The block height of the block in which the registration transaction was mined</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">kh</td><td align="left">The hash of the registration transaction's kernel</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>Base Nodes SHOULD maintain a cached list of VNs and MUST return the Node ID in response to a
<code>get_validator_node_id</code> request.</p>
<h3 id="validator-node-registration-1"><a class="header" href="#validator-node-registration-1">Validator Node Registration</a></h3>
<p>A VN MUST register on the base layer before it can join any Distributed Area Network (DAN) <a href="Glossary.html#committee">committee</a>s. Registration 
happens by virtue
of a VN registration <a href="Glossary.html#transaction">transaction</a>.</p>
<p>VN registrations are valid for the <a href="Glossary.html#registration-term">Registration Term</a>.</p>
<p>The registration term is set at SIX months.</p>
<p>A VN registration transaction is a special transaction.</p>
<ul>
<li>The transaction MUST have EXACTLY ONE UTXO with the <code>VN_Deposit</code> flag set.</li>
<li>This UTXO MUST also:
<ul>
<li>set a time lock for AT LEAST the <a href="Glossary.html#registration-term">Registration Term</a> (or equivalent block periods);</li>
<li>provide the <em>value</em> of the UTXO in the signature metadata; and</li>
<li>provide the <em>public key</em> for the spending key for the output in the signature metadata.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The value of this output MUST be equal to or greater than the <a href="Glossary.html#registration-deposit">Registration Deposit</a>.</li>
<li>The UTXO MUST store:
<ul>
<li>the value of the VN deposit UTXO as a u64; and</li>
<li>the value of the <em>public key</em> for the spending key for the output as 32 bytes in little-endian order.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The <code>KernelFeatures</code> bit flag MUST have the <code>VN_Registration</code> flag set.</li>
<li>The kernel MUST also store the VN's DHT public key as 32 bytes in little-endian order.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="validator-node-registration-renewal"><a class="header" href="#validator-node-registration-renewal">Validator Node Registration Renewal</a></h3>
<p>If a VN owner does not <em>renew</em> the registration before the <a href="Glossary.html#registration-term">Registration Term</a> has expired, the registration will lapse
and the VN will no longer be allowed to participate in any <a href="Glossary.html#committee">committee</a>s.</p>
<p>The number of consecutive renewals MAY increase the VN's reputation score.</p>
<p>A VN may only renew a registration in the TWO-WEEK period prior to the current term expiring.</p>
<p>A VN renewal transaction is a special transaction:</p>
<ul>
<li>The transaction MUST have EXACTLY ONE UTXO with the <code>VN_Deposit</code> flag set.</li>
<li>The transaction MUST spend the previous VN deposit UTXO for this VN.</li>
<li>This UTXO MUST also:
<ul>
<li>set a time lock for AT LEAST six months (or equivalent block periods);</li>
<li>provide the <em>value</em> of the transaction in the signature metadata; and</li>
<li>provide the <em>public key</em> for the spending key for the output in the signature metadata.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>This UTXO MUST also store:
<ul>
<li>The value of the VN deposit UTXO as a u64.</li>
<li>The value of the <em>public key</em> for the spending key for the output as 32 bytes in little-endian order;</li>
<li>The VN's Node ID. This can be validated by following the Renewal transaction kernel chain.</li>
<li>The kernel hash of this transaction's kernel.</li>
<li>A counter indicating that this is the n-th consecutive renewal. This counter will be confirmed by nodes and miners.
The first renewal will have a counter value of one.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The previous VN deposit UTXO MUST NOT be spendable in a standard transaction (i.e. its time lock has not expired).</li>
<li>The previous VN deposit UTXO MUST expire within the next TWO WEEKS.</li>
<li>The transaction MAY provide additional inputs to cover transaction fees and increases in the <a href="Glossary.html#registration-deposit">Registration Deposit</a>.</li>
<li>The transaction kernel MUST have the <code>VN_Renewal</code> bit flag set.</li>
<li>The transaction kernel MUST also store the hash of the previous renewal transaction kernel, or the registration kernel, 
if this is the first renewal.</li>
</ul>
<p>One will notice that a VN's Node ID does not change as a result of a renewal transaction. Rather, every
renewal adds to a chain linking back to the original registration transaction. It may be desirable to establish a long
chain of renewals, in order to offer evidence of longevity and improve a VN's reputation.</p>

<p>The aim of this Request for Comment (RFC) is to  describe the process in which an <a href="Glossary.html#asset-issuer">Asset Issuer</a> (AI) will need to engage to

<h3 id="abstract-3"><a class="header" href="#abstract-3">Abstract</a></h3>
<p>This document will describe the process through which an AI will go in order to:</p>
<ul>
<li>register a DA on the <a href="Glossary.html#base-layer">base layer</a>;</li>
<li>assemble a <a href="Glossary.html#committee">committee</a> of <a href="Glossary.html#validator-node">Validator Node</a>s (VNs); and</li>
<li>commence operation of the DA on the DAN.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="asset-creation-instruction"><a class="header" href="#asset-creation-instruction">Asset Creation Instruction</a></h3>
<p>The first step in registering and commencing the operation of an asset is that the AI MUST issue an asset creation 
transaction to the <a href="Glossary.html#base-layer">base layer</a>.</p>
<p>This transaction will be time-locked for the length of the desired nomination period. This ensures that this transaction 
cannot be spent until the nomination period has elapsed so that it is present during the entire nomination process. The 
value of the transaction will be the <code>asset_creation_fee</code> described in <a href="RFC-0311_AssetTemplates.html">RFC-0311</a>. The AI 
will spend the transaction back to themselves, but locking this fee up at this stage achieves two goals:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Firstly, it makes 
it expensive to spam the network with asset creation transactions that a malicious AI does not intend to complete.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Secondly, it proves to the VNs that participate in the nomination process that the AI does indeed have the funds 
required to commence operation of the asset once the committee has been selected.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If the asset registration process 
fails, e.g. if there are not enough available VNs for the committee, then the AI can refund the fee to themselves 
after the time lock expires.</p>
<p>The transaction will contain the following extra metadata to facilitate the registration process:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The value of the transaction in clear text and the public spending key of the commitment so that it can be verified 
by third parties. A third party can verify the value of the commitment by using the information in (1) and (2) below, to calculate (3):</p>
<ol>
<li>The output commitment is $ C = k \cdot G + v \cdot H $.</li>
<li>$ v​ $ and $ k \cdot G ​$ are provided in the metadata.</li>
<li>A verifier can calculate $ C - k \cdot G = v \cdot H $ and verify this value by multiplying the clear text $ v $ by $ H $ themselves.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>A commitment (hash) to the asset parameters as defined by a <a href="Glossary.html#digitalassettemplate">DigitalAssetTemplate</a> described in 
<a href="RFC-0311_AssetTemplates.html">RFC-0311</a>. This template will define all the parameters of the asset that the AI intends to 
register, including information the VNs need to know, such as what  <a href="Glossary.html#assetcollateral">AssetCollateral</a> is required to be part of the committee.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Once this transaction has been confirmed to the required depth on the blockchain, the nomination phase can begin.</p>
<h3 id="nomination-phase"><a class="header" href="#nomination-phase">Nomination Phase</a></h3>
<p>The next step in registering an asset is for the AI to select a committee of VNs to manage the asset. The process to do 
this is described in <a href="RFC-0304_VNCommittees.html">RFC-0304</a>. This process lasts as long as the time lock on the asset 
creation transaction described above. The VNs have until that time lock elapses to nominate themselves (in the case of 
an asset being registered using the <code>committee_mode::PUBLIC_NOMINATION</code> parameter in the <a href="Glossary.html#digitalassettemplate">DigitalAssetTemplate</a>).</p>
<h3 id="asset-commencement"><a class="header" href="#asset-commencement">Asset Commencement</a></h3>
<p>Once the nomination phase is complete and the AI has selected a committee as described in <a href="RFC-0304_VNCommittees.html">RFC-0304</a>, 
the chosen committee and AI are ready to commit their <code>asset_creation_fee</code> and <a href="Glossary.html#assetcollateral">AssetCollateral</a>s to commence the 
operation of the asset. This is done by the AI and the committee members collaborating to build the initial <a href="Glossary.html#checkpoint">Checkpoint</a> 
of the asset. When this <a href="Glossary.html#checkpoint">Checkpoint</a> transaction is published to the <a href="Glossary.html#base-layer">base layer</a>, the <a href="Glossary.html#digital-asset">digital asset</a> will be live on 
the DAN. The <a href="Glossary.html#checkpoint">Checkpoint</a> transaction is described in <a href="RFC-0220_AssetCheckpoints.html">RFC_0220</a>.</p>

<ul>

<li>VNs form a peer-to-peer communication network that together defines the Tari DAN.</li>
<li>VNs register themselves on the <a href="Glossary.html#base-layer">base layer</a> and commit collateral to prevent Sybil attacks.</li>
<li>Scalability is achieved by sacrificing decentralization. Not <em>all</em> VNs manage <em>every</em> asset. Assets are managed by
subsets of the DAN, called VN <a href="Glossary.html#committee">committees</a>. These committees reach consensus on DA state amongst themselves.</li>
<li>VNs earn fees for their efforts.</li>
<li>DA contracts are not Turing complete, but are instantiated by <a href="Glossary.html#asset-issuer">Asset Issuer</a>s (AIs) using <a href="Glossary.html#digitalassettemplate">DigitalAssetTemplate</a>s that are defined
in the DAN protocol code.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="digital-assets"><a class="header" href="#digital-assets">Digital Assets</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>DA contracts are <em>not</em> Turing complete, but are selected from a set of <a href="Glossary.html#digitalassettemplate">DigitalAssetTemplate</a>s that govern
the behaviour of each contract type. For example, there could be a Single-use Token template for simple ticketing systems, a
Coupon template for loyalty programmes, and so on.</li>
<li>The template system is intended to be highly flexible and additional templates can be added to the protocol periodically.</li>
<li>Asset issuers can link a Registered Asset Issuer Domain (RAID) ID in an OpenAlias TXT public Domain Name System (DNS) 
record to a Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) that they own. This is to help disambiguate similar
contracts and improve the signal-to-noise ratio from scam or copycat contracts.</li>
</ul>
<p>An AI will issue a DA by constructing a contract from one of the supported set of <a href="Glossary.html#digitalassettemplate">DigitalAssetTemplate</a>s. The AI will choose
how large the committee of VNs will be for this DA, and have the option to nominate <a href="Glossary.html#trusted-node">Trusted Node</a>s to be part of the VN 
committee for the DA.
Any remaining spots on the committee will be filled by permissionless VNs that are selected according to a 
<a href="Glossary.html#committeeselectionstrategy">CommitteeSelectionStrategy</a>. This is a strategy that an AI will use to select from the set of potential candidate VNs 
that nominated themselves for a position on the committee when the AI broadcast a public call for VNs during the asset 
creation process. For the VNs to accept the appointment to the committee, they will need to put up the specified collateral.</p>

<h3 id="alternative-approaches"><a class="header" href="#alternative-approaches">Alternative Approaches</a></h3>
<p>In order to easily differentiate <a href="Glossary.html#digital-asset">digital asset</a>s in the DAN, apart from some unique unpronounceable 
character string, a human-readable identifier (domain name) is required. It is perceived that shorter names will have 
higher value due to branding and marketability. The question is, how this can be managed elegantly? It is also 
undesirable if, for example, the real Disney is forced to use the long versioned &quot;<em>disney.com-goofy-is-my-asset-yes</em>&quot; 
because some fake Disneys claimed &quot;<em>goofy</em>&quot; and &quot;<em>disney.com-goofy</em>&quot; and everything in-between.</p>
<p>One method to curb name space squatting is to register names on the <a href="Glossary.html#base-layer">base layer</a> layer with a domain name registration 
transaction. Let us call such a name a Registered Asset Issuer Name (RAIN). To make registering RAINs difficult enough 
to prevent spamming the network, a certain amount of <a href="Glossary.html#tari-coin">Tari coins</a> must be committed in a burn (permanently destroy) or 
a time-locked pay-to-self type transaction. Lots of management overhead will be associated with such a scheme, even if 
domainless assets are allowed. However, it would be impossible to stop someone 
from registering, say, a &quot;<em>disney.com</em>&quot; RAIN if they did not own the real &quot;<em>disney.com</em>&quot; Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN).</p>
<p>Another approach would be to make use of the public Domain Name System (DNS) and to link the FQDNs that are already 
registered, to the <a href="Glossary.html#digital-asset">digital asset</a>s in the DAN, making use of <a href="https://openalias.org/">OpenAlias</a> text (TXT) DNS 
records on an FQDN. Let us call this a Registered Asset Issuer Domain (RAID) TXT record. If we hash a public key and 
FQDN pair, it will provide us with a unique RAID_ID (RAID Identification). The RAID_ID will serve a similar purpose in 
the DAN as a Top Level Domain (TLD) in a DNS, as all digital assets belonging to a specific <a href="Glossary.html#asset-issuer">asset issuer</a> could then 
be grouped under the FQDN by inference. To make this scheme more elaborate, but potentially unnecessary, all such 
RAID_IDs could also be registered on the <a href="Glossary.html#base-layer">base layer</a>, similar to the RAIN scheme.</p>
<p>If the standard Mimblewimble protocol is followed, a new output feature can be defined to cater for a RAID tuple 
<code>(RAID_ID, PubKey)</code> that is linked to a specific Unspent Transaction Output (<a href="Glossary.html#unspent-transaction-outputs">UTXO</a>). The <code>RAID_ID</code> could be based on 
a <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Base58Check_encoding">Base58Check</a> variant applied to <code>Hash256(PubKey || FQDN)</code>. If the 
amount of Tari coins associated with the RAID tuple transaction is burned, <code>(RAID_ID, PubKey)</code> will forever be present 
on the blockchain and can increase blockchain bloat. On the other hand, if those <a href="Glossary.html#tari-coin">Tari coins</a> are spent back to their 
owner with a specific time lock, it will be possible to spend and prune that UTXO later on. While that UTXO remains 
unspent, the RAID tuple will be valid, but when all or part of it is spent, the RAID tuple will disappear from the 
blockchain. Such a UTXO will thus be &quot;coloured&quot; while unspent, as it will have different properties to a normal UTXO. It 
will also be possible to recreate the original RAID tuple by registering it using the original <code>Hash256(PubKey || FQDN)</code>.</p>
<p>Thinking about the make-up of the <code>RAID_ID</code>, it is evident that it can easily be calculated on the fly using the public 
key and FQDN, the values of which will always be known. The biggest advantage of having the RAID tuple on the <a href="Glossary.html#base-layer">base 
layer</a> is that of embedded consensus, where it will be validated (as no duplicates can be allowed) and mined before it 
can be used. However, this comes at the cost of more complex code, a more elaborate asset registration process and 
higher asset registration fees.</p>

<p>This RFC explores the creation and use of RAID TXT records to link asset issuer-specified domain names with 
digital assets on the <a href="Glossary.html#digital-asset-network">DAN</a>, without RAID_IDs being registered on the <a href="Glossary.html#base-layer">base layer</a>.</p>
<h2 id="requirements"><a class="header" href="#requirements">Requirements</a></h2>
<h3 id="openalias-txt-dns-records"><a class="header" href="#openalias-txt-dns-records">OpenAlias TXT DNS Records</a></h3>
<p>An OpenAlias TXT DNS record [<a href="https://docs.rs/openalias/0.2.0/openalias/index.html" title="Crate openalias">1</a>] on an FQDN is a single string and starts with &quot;<em>oa1:&lt;name&gt;</em>&quot; field followed by a 
number of key-value pairs. Standard (optional) key values are: &quot;<em>recipient_address</em>&quot;; &quot;<em>recipient_name</em>&quot;; 
&quot;<em>tx_description</em>&quot;; &quot;<em>tx_amount</em>&quot;; &quot;<em>tx_payment_id</em>&quot;; &quot;<em>address_signature</em>&quot;; and &quot;<em>checksum</em>&quot;. Additional key values 
may also be defined. Only entities with write access to a specific DNS record will be able to create the required TXT 
DNS record entries.</p>
<p>TXT DNS records are limited to multiple strings of size 255, and as the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) size is 512 bytes, 
a TXT DNS record that exceeds that limit is less optimal [<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7208" title="RFC 7208">2</a>, Sections 3.3 and 3.4]. Some hosting sites also place 
limitations on TXT DNS record string lengths and concatenation of multiple strings as per [<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7208" title="RFC 7208">2</a>]. The basic idea of this 
specification is to make the implementation robust and flexible at the same time.</p>
<p><strong>Req</strong> - Integration with public DNS records MUST be used to ensure valid ownership of an FQDN that needs to be 
linked to a <a href="Glossary.html#digital-asset">digital asset</a> on the DAN. </p>
<p><strong>Req</strong> - The total size of the OpenAlias TXT DNS record SHOULD NOT exceed 255 characters.</p>
<p><strong>Req</strong> - The total size of the OpenAlias TXT DNS record MUST NOT exceed 512 characters.</p>
<p><strong>Req</strong> - The OpenAlias TXT DNS record implementation MUST make provision to interpret entries that are made up of more 
than one string as defined in [<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7208" title="RFC 7208">2</a>].</p>
<p><strong>Req</strong> - The OpenAlias TXT DNS record SHOULD adhere to the formatting requirements as specified in [<a href="https://docs.rs/openalias/0.2.0/openalias/index.html" title="Crate openalias">1</a>].</p>
<p><strong>Req</strong> - The OpenAlias TXT DNS record MUST be constructed as follows:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th>OpenAlias TXT DNS Record Field</th><th>OpenAlias TXT DNS Record Data</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>oa1:&lt;name&gt;</td><td>&quot;oa1:tari&quot;</td></tr>

<h3 id="raid_id"><a class="header" href="#raid_id">RAID_ID</a></h3>
<p>Because the <code>RAID_ID</code> does not exist as an entity on the base layer or in the <a href="Glossary.html#digital-asset-network">DAN</a>, it cannot be owned or 
transferred, but can only be verified as part of the OpenAlias TXT DNS record [<a href="https://docs.rs/openalias/0.2.0/openalias/index.html" title="Crate openalias">1</a>] verification. If an asset creator 
chooses not to link a <code>RAID_ID</code> and FQDN, a default network-assigned <code>RAID_ID</code> will be used in the digital asset 
registration process.</p>
<p><strong>Req</strong> - A default <code>RAID_ID</code> MUST be used where it will not be linked to an FQDN, e.g. it MAY be derived
from a default input string <code>&quot;No FQDN&quot;</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Req</strong> - An FQDN-linked (non-default) <code>RAID_ID</code> MUST be derived from the concatenation <code>PubKey || &lt;FQDN&gt;</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Req</strong> - All concatenations of inputs for any hash algorithm MUST be done without adding any spaces.</p>
<p><strong>Req</strong> - The hash algorithm MUST be <code>Blake2b</code> using a 32 byte digest size, unless otherwise specified.</p>
<p><strong>Req</strong> - Deriving a <code>RAID_ID</code> MUST be calculated as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Inputs for all hashing algorithms used to calculate the <code>RAID_ID</code> MUST be lower-case characters.</li>
<li>Stage 1 - MUST select the input string to use (either <code>&quot;No FQDN&quot;</code> or <code>PubKey || &lt;FQDN&gt;</code>).
<ul>
<li>Example: Mimblewimble public key <code>ca469346d7643336c19155fdf5c6500a5232525ce4eba7e4db757639159e9861</code> and FQDN 
<code>disney.com</code> are used here, resulting in <code>ca469346d7643336c19155fdf5c6500a5232525ce4eba7e4db757639159e9861disney.com</code>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Stage 2 - MUST perform <code>Blake2b</code> hashing on the result of stage 1 using a 10 byte digest size.
<ul>
<li>Example: In hexadecimal representation <code>ff517a1387153cc38009</code> or binary representation<code>\xffQz\x13\x87\x15&lt;\xc3\x80\t</code>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Stage 3 - MUST concatenate the <code>RAID_ID</code> identifier byte, <code>0x62</code>, with the result of stage 2.
<ul>
<li>Example: <code>62ff517a1387153cc38009</code> `.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Stage 4 - MUST convert the result of stage 3 from a byte string into a <code>Base58</code> encoded string. 
This will result in a 15 character string starting with <code>R</code>.
<ul>
<li>Example: The resulting <code>RAID_ID</code> will be <code>RYqMMuSmBZFQkgp</code>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Req</strong> - A valid <code>RAID_ID</code> signature MUST be a 256 bit Schnorr signature defined as <code>s = PvtNonce + e·PvtKey</code> with 
the challenge <code>e</code> being <code>e = Blake2b(PubNonce || PubKey || RAID_ID)</code>.</p>
<h3 id="sequence-of-events"><a class="header" href="#sequence-of-events">Sequence of Events</a></h3>
<p>The sequence of events leading up to digital asset registration is perceived as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The <a href="Glossary.html#asset-issuer">asset issuer</a> will decide if the default <code>RAID_ID</code> or a <code>RAID_ID</code> that is linked to an FQDN must be used for 
asset registration. 
(<em><strong>Note:</strong> A single linked (<code>RAID_ID</code>, FQDN) tuple may be associated with multiple digital assets from the same 
asset issuer.</em>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Req</strong> - If a default <code>RAID_ID</code> is required:</p>
<ol>
<li>The asset issuer MUST use the default <code>RAID_ID</code> (refer to <a href="RFC-0301_NamespaceRegistration.html#raid_id">RAID_ID</a>).</li>
<li>The asset issuer MUST NOT sign the <code>RAID_ID</code>.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Req</strong> - If a linked (<code>RAID_ID</code>, FQDN) tuple is required:</p>
<ol>
<li>The asset issuer MUST create a <code>RAID_ID</code>.</li>
<li>The asset issuer MUST sign the <code>RAID_ID</code> as specified (refer to <a href="RFC-0301_NamespaceRegistration.html#raid_id">RAID_ID</a>).</li>
<li>The asset issuer MUST create a valid TXT DNS record (refer to <a href="RFC-0301_NamespaceRegistration.html#openalias-txt-dns-records">OpenAlias TXT DNS Records</a>).</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Req</strong> - <a href="Glossary.html#validator-node">Validator Node</a>s (VNs) MUST only allow a valid <code>RAID_ID</code> to be used in the digital asset registration 
process.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Req</strong> - VNs MUST verify the OpenAlias TXT DNS record if a linked (<code>RAID_ID</code>, FQDN) tuple is used:</p>
<ol>
<li>Verify that all fields have been completed as per the specification (refer to 
<a href="RFC-0301_NamespaceRegistration.html#openalias-txt-dns-records">OpenAlias TXT DNS Records</a>).</li>
<li>Verify that the <code>RAID_ID</code> can be calculated from information provided in the TXT DNS record and the FQDN of the 
public DNS record it is in.</li>
<li>Verify that the asset issuer's <code>RAID_ID</code> signature is valid.</li>
<li>Verify the checksum.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="confidentiality-and-security"><a class="header" href="#confidentiality-and-security">Confidentiality and Security</a></h3>
<p>To prevent client lookups from leaking, OpenAlias recommends making use of <a href="https://dnscrypt.info/">DNSCrypt</a>, 
resolution via DNSCrypt-compatible resolvers that support Domain Name System Security Extensions (DNSSEC) and without 
DNS requests being logged.</p>
<p><strong>Req</strong> - <a href="Glossary.html#token-wallet">Token Wallet</a>s (TWs) and VNs SHOULD implement the following confidentiality and security measures when 
dealing with OpenAlias TXT DNS records:</p>
<ul>
<li>All queries SHOULD make use of the DNSCrypt protocol.</li>

<p>The aim of this Request for Comment (RFC) is to describe the responsibilities of Validator Nodes (VNs) on the Digital 
Asset Network (DAN).</p>

<h3 id="abstract-5"><a class="header" href="#abstract-5">Abstract</a></h3>
<p><a href="Glossary.html#validator-node">Validator Node</a>s form the basis of the second-layer DAN. All actions on this network take place by interacting with VNs. 
Some examples of actions
that VNs will facilitate are:</p>
<ul>
<li>issuing a <a href="Glossary.html#digital-asset">Digital Asset</a> (DA);</li>
<li>querying the state of a DA and its constituent <a href="Glossary.html#digital-asset-tokens">tokens</a>; and</li>
<li>issuing an instruction to change the state of a DA or tokens.</li>
</ul>
<p>VNs will also perform archival functions for the assets they manage. The lifetime of these archives and the fee structure 
for this function are
still being discussed.</p>
<h4 id="registration"><a class="header" href="#registration">Registration</a></h4>
<p>VNs register themselves on the <a href="Glossary.html#base-layer">Base Layer</a> using a special <a href="Glossary.html#transaction">transaction</a> type.</p>
<p>Validator node registration is described in <a href="RFC-0322_VNRegistration.html">RFC-0322</a>.</p>
<h4 id="execution-of-instructions"><a class="header" href="#execution-of-instructions">Execution of Instructions</a></h4>
<p>VNs are expected to manage the state of DAs on behalf of DA issuers. They receive fees as reward
for doing this.</p>
<ul>
<li>DAs consist of an initial state plus a set of state transition rules. These rules are set by the Tari
protocol, but will usually provide parameters that must be specified by the <a href="Glossary.html#asset-issuer">Asset Issuer</a>.</li>
<li>The set of VNs that participate in managing state of a specific DA is called a <a href="Glossary.html#committee">Committee</a>. A committee is selected 
during the asset
issuance process and membership of the committee can be updated at <a href="Glossary.html#checkpoint">Checkpoint</a>s.</li>
<li>The VN is responsible for ensuring that every state change in a DA conforms to the contract's rules.</li>
<li>VNs accept DA <a href="Glossary.html#instructions">Instructions</a> from clients and peers. Instructions allow for creating, updating, expiring and 
archiving DAs on the DAN.</li>
<li>VNs provide additional collateral, called <a href="Glossary.html#assetcollateral">AssetCollateral</a>, when accepting an offer to manage an asset, which is 
stored in a multi-signature (multi-sig)
Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) on the base layer. This collateral can be taken from the VN if it is proven that the 
VN engaged in
malicious behaviour.</li>
<li>VNs participate in fraud-proof validations in the event of consensus disputes (which could result in the malicious VN's
collateral being slashed).</li>
<li>DA metadata (e.g. large images) is managed by VNs. The large data itself will not be stored on the VNs, but 
in an external location, and a hash of the data can be stored. Whether the data is considered part of the state
(and thus checkpointed) or out of state depends on the type of DA contract employed.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="fees"><a class="header" href="#fees">Fees</a></h4>
<p>Fees will be paid to VNs based on the amount of work they did during a checkpoint period. The fees will be paid from a 
fee pool, which will be collected
and reside in a UTXO that is accessible by the committee. The exact mechanism for the payment of the fees by the 
committee and who pays the various
types of fees is still under discussion.</p>
<h4 id="checkpoints"><a class="header" href="#checkpoints">Checkpoints</a></h4>
<p>VNs periodically post checkpoint summaries to the <a href="Glossary.html#base-layer">base layer</a> for each asset that they are managing. The checkpoints 
will form an immutable
record of the DA state on the base layer. There will be two types of checkpoints:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>An Opening Checkpoint (OC) will:</p>
<ul>
<li>specify the members of the VN committee;</li>
<li>lock up the collateral for the committee members for this checkpoint period; and</li>
<li>collect the fee pool for this checkpoint period from the Asset Issuer into a multi-sig UTXO under the control of the 
committee.
This can be a top-up of the fees or a whole new fee pool.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>A Closing Checkpoint (CC) will:</p>
<ul>
<li>summarize the DA state on the base layer;</li>
<li>release the fee payouts;</li>
<li>release the collateral for the committee members for this checkpoint period; and</li>
<li>allow for committee members to resign from the committee.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>After a DA is issued, there will immediately be an OC. After a checkpoint period there will then be a 
CC, followed
immediately by an OC for the next period. We will call this set of checkpoints an Intermediate checkpoint, which could be a compressed combination of an OC and CC. This will continue
until the end of the asset's lifetime, when there will be a final CC that will be followed by the retirement of the asset.</p>

<h4 id="consensus"><a class="header" href="#consensus">Consensus</a></h4>
<p>Committees of VNs will use a <a href="Glossary.html#consensusstrategy">ConsensusStrategy</a> to manage the process of:</p>
<ul>
<li>propagating signed instructions between members of the committee; and</li>
<li>determining when the threshold has been reached for an instruction to be considered valid.</li>
</ul>
<p>Part of the Consensus Strategy will be mechanisms for detecting actions by <a href="Glossary.html#bad-actor">Bad Actor</a>s. The nature of the enforcement 
actions that can be taken
against bad actors is still to be decided.</p>
<h3 id="network-communication"><a class="header" href="#network-communication">Network Communication</a></h3>
<p>The VNs will communicate using a Peer-to-Peer (P2P) network. To facilitate this, the VNs must perform the following functions:</p>
<ul>
<li>VNs MUST maintain a list of peers, including which assets each peer is managing.</li>
<li>VNs MUST relay <a href="Glossary.html#instructions">instructions</a> to members of the committee that are managing the relevant asset.</li>
<li>VNs MUST respond to requests for information about DAs that they manage on the DAN.</li>
<li>VNs and clients can advertise public keys to facilitate P2P communication encryption.</li>

<a href="RFC-0300_DAN.html">RFC-0300</a> and <a href="RFC-0302_ValidatorNodes.html">RFC-0302</a>. During the asset creation process, described in 
<a href="RFC-0341_AssetRegistration.html">RFC-0341</a>, the <a href="Glossary.html#asset-issuer">Asset Issuer</a> (AI) MUST select a committee of VNs to manage their asset. 
This process consists of the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Candidate VNs MUST be nominated to be considered for selection by the AI.</li>
<li>The AI MUST employ a <a href="Glossary.html#committeeselectionstrategy">CommitteeSelectionStrategy</a> to select VNs from the set of nominated candidates.</li>
<li>The AI MUST make an offer of committee membership to the selected VNs.</li>
<li>Selected VNs MAY accept the offer to become part of the committee by posting the required <a href="Glossary.html#assetcollateral">AssetCollateral</a>.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="nomination"><a class="header" href="#nomination">Nomination</a></h3>
<p>The first step in assembling a committee is to nominate candidate VNs. As described in 
<a href="RFC-0311_AssetTemplates.html">RFC-0311</a>, an asset can be created with two possible <code>committee_modes</code> - <code>CREATOR_NOMINATION</code> 
or <code>PUBLIC_NOMINATION</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li>In <code>CREATOR_NOMINATION</code> mode, the AI nominates candidate committee members directly. The AI will have a list of permissioned 
<a href="Glossary.html#trusted-node">Trusted Node</a>s that they want to act as the committee. The AI will contact the candidate VNs directly to inform them of 
their nomination.</li>
<li>In <code>PUBLIC_NOMINATION</code> mode, the AI does not have a list of <a href="Glossary.html#trusted-node">Trusted Node</a>s and wants to source unknown VNs from the 
network. In this case, the AI broadcasts a public call for nomination to the Tari network using the peer-to-peer messaging 
protocol described in <a href="RFC-0172_PeerToPeerMessagingProtocol.html">RFC-0172</a>. This call for nomination contains all the 
details of the asset. VNs that want to participate will then nominate themselves by contacting the AI.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="selection"><a class="header" href="#selection">Selection</a></h3>
<p>Once the AI has received a list of nominated VNs, it must make a selection, assuming enough VNs were nominated to populate 
the committee. The AI will employ some <a href="Glossary.html#committeeselectionstrategy">CommitteeSelectionStrategy</a> in order to select the committee from the candidate 
VNs that have been nominated. This strategy might aim for a perfectly random selection, or perhaps it will consider some 
metrics about the candidate VNs, such as the length of their VN registrations. These metrics might indicate that they are reliable 
and have not been denylisted for poor or malicious performance.</p>
<p>A consideration when selecting a committee in <code>PUBLIC_NOMINATION</code> mode will be the size of the pool of nominated VNs. 
The size of this pool relative to the size of the committee to be selected will be linked to a risk profile. If the pool 
contains very few candidates, then it will be much easier for an attacker to have nominated their own nodes in order to 
obtain a majority membership of the committee. For example, if the AI is selecting a committee of 10 members using a uniformly 
random selection strategy and only 12 public nominations are received, an attacker only requires control of six VNs to 
achieve a majority position in the committee. In contrast, if 100 nominations are received and the AI performs a 
uniformly random selection, an attacker would need to control more than 50 of the nominated nodes in order to achieve a 
majority position in the committee.</p>
<h3 id="offer-acceptance"><a class="header" href="#offer-acceptance">Offer Acceptance</a></h3>
<p>Once the selection has been made by the AI, the selected VNs will be informed and they will be made an offer of membership. 
If the VNs are still inclined to join the committee, they will accept the offer by posting the <a href="Glossary.html#assetcollateral">AssetCollateral</a> 
required by the asset to the <a href="Glossary.html#base-layer">base layer</a> during the initial <a href="Glossary.html#checkpoint">Checkpoint</a> transaction built to commence the operation of 
the asset.</p>

<p>The aim of this Request for Comment (RFC) is to describe the Tari Digital Asset templating system for smart contract 
definition.</p>
<p>The term “smart contracts” in this document is used to refer to a set of rules enforced by computers. These smart
contracts are not Turing complete, such as those executed by the Ethereum Virtual Machine (VM).</p>
<h2 id="related-requests-for-comment-21"><a class="header" href="#related-requests-for-comment-21">Related Requests for Comment</a></h2>

<h3 id="motivation"><a class="header" href="#motivation">Motivation</a></h3>
<p>The reasons for issuing assets on Tari under a templating system, rather than a scripting language (whether Turing
complete or not), are manifold:</p>
<ul>
<li>A scripting language, irrespective of how simple it is, limits the target market for asset issuers to developers, or
people who pay developers.</li>
<li>The market doesn’t want general smart contracts. This is evidenced by the fact that the vast majority of Ethereum
transactions go through ERC-20 or ERC-721 contracts, which are literally contract templates.</li>
<li>The attack surface for smart contracts is reduced considerably, to the node software itself.</li>
<li>Bugs can be fixed for all contracts simultaneously by using a template versioning system. Existing assets can opt in
to fixes by migrating assets to a new version of the contract.</li>
<li>Contracts will have better Quality Assurance (QA), since more eyes are looking at fewer contract code sets.</li>
<li>Transmission, storage and processing of contracts will be more efficient, as one only has to deal with the parameters,
and not the logic of the contract. Furthermore, the cost for users is usually lower, since there's no need to add
friction or extra costs to contract execution (e.g. Ethereum gas) to work around the halting problem.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="implementation"><a class="header" href="#implementation">Implementation</a></h3>
<p>Assets are created on the Tari network by issuing a <code>create_asset</code> instruction from a wallet or client, and broadcasting
it to the Tari Digital Assets Network (DAN).</p>
<p>The instruction is in JSON format and MUST contain the following fields:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th>Name</th><th>Type</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody>

<h4 id="committee-parameters"><a class="header" href="#committee-parameters">Committee Parameters</a></h4>

</tbody></table>
<h4 id="issuer"><a class="header" href="#issuer">Issuer</a></h4>
<p>Anyone can create new assets on the Tari network from their Tari Collections client. The client will provide the Public Key Hash (PKH) and
sign the instruction. The client needn’t use the same private key each time.</p>
<h4 id="name-and-description"><a class="header" href="#name-and-description">Name and Description</a></h4>
<p>These fields are purely for information purposes. They do not need to be unique and do not act as an asset ID.</p>
<h4 id="raid-id"><a class="header" href="#raid-id">RAID ID</a></h4>
<p>The RAID_ID is a 15-character string that associates the asset issuer with a registered Internet domain name on the Domain Name System (DNS).</p>
<p>If it is likely that a digital asset issuer will be issuing many assets on the Tari Network (hundreds or thousands),
the issuer should strongly consider using a registered domain (e.g. <code>acme.com</code>). This is
done via OpenAlias on the domain owner's DNS record, as described in <a href="RFC-0301_NamespaceRegistration.html">RFC-0301</a>. A RAID prevents spoofing of assets from 
copycats or other malicious actors. It also simplifies asset discovery.</p>
<p>Assets from issuers that do not have a RAID are all grouped under the default RAID.</p>
<p>RAID owners must provide a valid signature proving that they own the given domain when creating assets.</p>
<h4 id="fully-qualified-domain-name"><a class="header" href="#fully-qualified-domain-name">Fully Qualified Domain Name</a></h4>
<p>The Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) that corresponds to the <code>raid_id</code> or the string <code>&quot;NO FQDN&quot;</code> to use the default RAID ID.
Validator Nodes (VNs) will calculate and check that the RAID ID is valid when
<a href="RFC-0311_AssetTemplates.html#signature-validation">validating the instruction signature</a>.</p>
<h4 id="public-nonce"><a class="header" href="#public-nonce">Public Nonce</a></h4>
<p>A single-use public nonce to be used in the asset signature.</p>
<h4 id="asset-identification"><a class="header" href="#asset-identification">Asset Identification</a></h4>
<p>Assets are identified by a 64-character string that uniquely identifies an asset on the network:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th align="left">Bytes</th><th align="left">Description</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td align="left">8</td><td align="left">Template type (hex)</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">4</td><td align="left">Template version (hex)</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">4</td><td align="left">Feature flags (hex)</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">15</td><td align="left">RAID identifier (Base58)</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">1</td><td align="left">A period character, <code>.</code></td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">32</td><td align="left">Hex representation of the <code>metadata_hash</code> field</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>This allows assets to be deterministically identified from their initial state. Two different creation instructions
leading to the same hash refer to the same single asset, by definition. VNs maintain an index of assets and
their committees, and so can determine whether a given asset already exists; and MUST reject any <code>create_asset</code>
instruction for an existing asset.</p>
<h4 id="template-id"><a class="header" href="#template-id">Template ID</a></h4>
<p>Tari uses templates to define the behaviour for its smart contracts. The template ID refers to the type of digital asset
being created.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Integer values are given in <em>little-endian</em> format, i.e. the least significant bit is <em>first</em>.</p>
<p>The template number is a 64-bit unsigned integer and has the following format, with 0 representing
the least significant bit:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th align="left">Bit Range</th><th align="left">Description</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td align="left">0 - 31</td><td align="left">Template type (0 - 4,294,967,295)</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">32 - 47</td><td align="left">Template version (0 - 65,535)</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">48</td><td align="left">Beta Mode flag</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">49</td><td align="left">Confidentiality flag</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">50 - 63</td><td align="left">Reserved (must be 0)</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>The lowest 32 bits refer to the canonical smart contract type, i.e. the qualitative types of contracts the network supports.
Many assets can be issued from a single template.</p>
<p>Template types below 65,536 (2<sup>16</sup>) are public, community-developed templates.
All VNs MUST implement and be able to interpret instructions related to these templates.</p>
<p>Template types 65,536 and above are opt-in or proprietary templates. There is no guarantee that any given VN
will be able to manage assets on these templates. Part of the committee selection and confirmation process for new
assets will be an attestation by VNs that they are willing and able to manage the asset under the designated
template rules.</p>
<p>A global registry of opt-in template types will be necessary to prevent collisions (public templates existence will be
evident from the Validator Node source code), possibly implemented as a special transaction type on the base layer, 
which is perfectly suited for hosting such a registry. The details of this will be covered in a separate
proposal.</p>
<p>Examples of template types may be:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th align="left">Template Type</th><th align="left">Asset</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td align="left">1</td><td align="left">Simple single-use tokens</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">2</td><td align="left">Simple coupons</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">20</td><td align="left">ERC-20-compatible</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">...</td><td align="left">...</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">120</td><td align="left">Collectible cards</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">144</td><td align="left">In-game items</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">721</td><td align="left">ERC-721-compatible</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">...</td><td align="left">...</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">65,537</td><td align="left">Acme In game items</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">723,342</td><td align="left">CryptoKitties v8</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>The template ID may also set one or more feature flags to indicate that the contract is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Experimental, or in testing phase (bit 48).</li>
<li>Confidential. The definition of confidential assets and their implementation had not been finalized at the time of writing.</li>
</ul>
<p>Wallets/client apps SHOULD have settings to allow, or otherwise completely ignore, asset types on the network that have
certain feature flags enabled. For instance, most consumer wallets should never interact with templates that have the
“Beta mode” bit set. Only developers' wallets should ever even see that such assets exist.</p>
<h4 id="asset-expiry"><a class="header" href="#asset-expiry">Asset Expiry</a></h4>
<p>Asset issuers can set a future expiry date or block height, after which the asset will expire and nodes will be free to
expunge any/all state relating to the asset from memory after a fixed grace period. The grace period is to allow
interested parties (e.g. the issuer) to take a snapshot of the final state of the contract if they wish (e.g. proving
that you had a ticket for that epic World Cup final game, even after the asset no longer exists on the DAN).</p>
<p>Nodes will publish a final checkpoint on the base layer soon after expiry and before purging an asset.</p>
<p>The expiry_date is a Unix epoch, representing the number of seconds since 1 January 1970 00:00:00 UTC if the value is
greater than 1,500,000,000; or a block height if it is less than that value (with 1 min blocks this scheme is valid
until the year 4870).</p>
<p>Expiry times should not be considered exact, since nodes don’t share the same clocks and block heights, and time proxies
become more inaccurate the further out you go (since height in the future is dependent on hash rate).</p>
<h3 id="signature-validation"><a class="header" href="#signature-validation">Signature Validation</a></h3>
<p>Validator nodes will verify the <code>creator_sig</code> for every <code>create_asset</code> instruction before propagating the instruction to
the network. The process is as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The VN MUST calculate the metadata hash by hashing the canonical representation of all the data in the first three
sections of the <code>create_asset</code> instruction.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The VN MUST compare this calculated value to the value given in the <code>metadata_hash</code> field. If they do not match, the 
VN MUST drop
the instruction and STOP.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The VN MUST calculate the RAID ID from the <code>fqdn</code> and <code>issuer</code> fields as specified in <a href="RFC-0301_NamespaceRegistration.html">RFC-0301</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The VN MUST compare the calculated RAID ID with the value given in the <code>raid_id</code> field. If they do not match, the VN 
MUST drop
the instruction and STOP.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the <code>fqdn</code> is `&quot;No FQDN&quot;, then skip to step 9.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The VN MUST Look up the OpenAlias TXT record at the domain given in <code>fqdn</code>. If the record  does not exist, then the 
VN MUST
drop the instruction and STOP.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The VN MUST check that each of the public key and RAID ID in the TXT record match the values in the <code>create_asset</code>
instruction. If any values do not match, the VN MUST then drop the instruction and STOP.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The VN MUST validate the registration signature in the TXT record, using the TXT record's nonce, the issuer's public
key and the RAID ID. If the signature does not verify, the VN MUST drop the instruction and STOP.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The VN MUST validate the signature in the <code>creator_sig</code> field against the challenge built up from the issuer's public
key, the nonce given in <code>public_nonce</code> field, the <code>raid_id</code> field and the <code>metadata_hash</code> field.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If step 9 passes, then the VN has proven that the <code>create_asset</code> contains a valid RAID ID, and that if a non-default
FQDN was provided, the owner of that domain provided the <code>create_asset</code> instruction. In this case, the VN SHOULD
propagate the instruction to the network.</p>

<p>Tari digital assets are created on the <a href="RFC-0300_DAN.html">Digital Assets Network</a>, managed by a Validator Node (VN)
committee, see <a href="RFC-0340_VNConsensusOverview.html">RFC-0340</a>, and are operated under the rules of the
<a href="RFC-0311_AssetTemplates.html">template</a> that governs the asset.</p>
<p>A <em>given version</em> of a template provides an immutable definition of the type of information (the state) that is managed
during the lifetime of the asset. <em>All</em> the rules that govern reading and updating of the asset state, and rules
regarding any transfers of tokens that may be defined as part of the asset are governed by the template code.</p>
<p>This immutability is what allows VN committees to reach rapid consensus about what an asset’s state looks<br />
like after <a href="Glossary.html#instructions">instructions</a> are executed.</p>
<p>However, immutability is a major problem when faced with typical software and business development challenges such as
software bugs, or changes in legal and operational requirements.</p>
<p>The Tari network is designed to accommodate these requirements by offering a migration path for assets from one version
of a template to another version of a template.</p>
<h3 id="asset-migration"><a class="header" href="#asset-migration">Asset migration</a></h3>
<p>To carry out a successful migration, the following requirements must be met:</p>
<ul>
<li>The validator node committee for the asset must support the migration path. This entails that <em>every</em> VN in the
committee has a <code>MigrateAsset</code> class from the <code>template_type.version</code> combination of the existing asset to the
<code>template_type.version</code> of the new asset.</li>
<li>The original asset issuer provides a valid <code>migrate_asset</code> instruction to the DAN.
<ul>
<li>The asset issuer MUST provide any additional state that exists in the new template version and not the original.</li>
<li>The original asset SHOULD be marked as <code>retired</code>. If so, the <code>superseded_by</code> field in the old asset will carry the
new asset id once the new asset has been confirmed. We recommend retiring the old asset because all the keys that
indicate ownership of tokens will be copied over; effectively re-using them; which can damage privacy.</li>
<li>A policy is provided to determine the course of action to follow if any state from the old asset is illegal under
the new template rules (e.g. If a new rule requires <code>token.age</code> to be &gt; 21; what happens to any tokens where this
condition fails?)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As part of the migration,</p>
<ol>
<li>An entirely new asset is created with the full state of the old asset copied over into the new asset; supplemented
with any additional state required in the new template.</li>
<li>A state validation run is performed; and any invalid state from the old asset is modified according to the migration
policy.</li>
<li>Step 2 is repeated until a valid initial state is produced.</li>
<li>If Step 2 has run <code>STATE_VALIDATION_LIMIT</code> times and the initial state is still not valid, the migration instruction
is rejected; the migrate_asset instruction will advise what should be done with the original asset in this case:
either allow the original asset to continue as before, or retire it.</li>
<li>Once a valid initial state is produced, a new <code>create_asset</code> instruction is generated from the initial
state and the <code>migrate_asset</code> instruction. Typically the same VN committee will be used for the new asset, but this
needn’t be the case.</li>
</ol>
<p>Once a successful migration has completed, any instructions to the old asset can return a simple <code>asset_migrated</code>
response with the new asset ID, which will allow clients and wallets to seamlessly update their records.</p>
<h3 id="retiring-assets"><a class="header" href="#retiring-assets">Retiring Assets</a></h3>
<p>Retiring an asset follows the same procedure as when as asset reaches its natural end-of-life: A final checkpoint is
posted to the base layer and a grace period is given to allow DAN nodes and clients to take a snapshot of the final
state if desired.</p>
<h3 id="resurrecting-assets"><a class="header" href="#resurrecting-assets">Resurrecting assets</a></h3>
<p>It’s unreasonable to expect VNs to hold onto large chunks of state for assets that are effectively dead (e.g. ticket
stubs long after the event is over). For this reason, assets are allowed to expire after which VNs can forget about the
state and use that storage for something else.</p>
<p>However, it may be that interest in an asset resurfaces long after the asset expires (nostalgia being the multi-billion
dollar industry it is today). The <code>resurrect_asset</code> instruction provides a mechanism to bring an asset back to life.</p>
<p>To resurrect an asset, the following conditions must be met:</p>
<ul>
<li>The asset must have expired.</li>
<li>It must not be currently active (i.e. it hasn’t already been resurrected).</li>
<li>An asset issuer (not necessarily the original asset issuer) must provide funding for the new lifetime of the asset.</li>
<li>The asset issuer needs to have a copy of the state corresponding to the final asset checkpoint of the original asset.</li>
<li>The new asset issuer transmits a <code>resurrect_asset</code> instruction to the network. This instruction is identical to the
original <code>create_asset</code> instruction with the following exceptions:
<ul>
<li>The “initial state” merkle root must be equal to the final state checkpoint merkle root.</li>
<li>The asset owner public key will be provided by the new asset issuer.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Third parties can interrogate the new committee asking them to provide a Merkle Proof for pieces of state that the
third party (perhaps former asset owners) knows about. This can mitigate fraud attempts where parties can attempt to
resurrect assets without actually having a copy of the smart contract state. If enough random state proofs are
requested, or a single proof of enough random pieces of state, we can be confident that the asset resurrection is
legitimate.</li>
</ul>
<p>The VN committee for the resurrected asset need not bear any relation to the original VN committee.
Once confirmed, the resurrected asset operates exactly like any other asset.
An asset can expire and be resurrected multiple times (sequentially).</p>

<h3 id="overview-2"><a class="header" href="#overview-2">Overview</a></h3>
<p>The primary problem under consideration here is for multiple machines running the same program (in the form of a Tari
smart contract) to maintain agreement on what the state of the program is, often under adverse conditions, including
unreliable network communication, malicious third parties, or even malicious peers running the smart contract.</p>
<p>In computer science terms, the problem is referred to as
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_machine_replication">State Machine Replication</a>, or SMR. If we want our honest
machines (referred to as <em>replicas</em> in SMR parlance) to reach agreement in the face of arbitrary failures, then we talk
about our system being
<a href="https://tlu.tarilabs.com/consensus-mechanisms/BFT-consensusmechanisms/sources/PITCHME.link.html">Byzantine Fault Tolerant</a>.</p>
<p>Tari Asset <a href="Glossary.html#committee">committees</a> are chosen by the asset issuer according to <a href="RFC-0304_VNCommittees.html">RFC-0304</a>. The committees
form a fixed set of replicas, at the very least from checkpoint to checkpoint, and will typically be limited in size,
usually less than ten, and almost always under 100. <em>Note</em>: These numbers are highly speculative based on an intuitive
guess about the main use cases for Tari DAs, where we have</p>
<ul>
<li>many 1-3-sized committees where the asset issuer and the VN committee are the same entity,</li>
<li>semi-decentralised assets of ±4-10 where speed trumps censorship-resistance,</li>
<li>a small number of 50-100 VNs where censorship-resistance trumps speed.</li>
</ul>
<p>Because nodes cannot join and leave the committees at will, robust yet slow and expensive consensus approaches such as
Nakamoto consensus can be dropped in favour of something more performant.</p>
<p>There is a good survey of consensus mechanisms on
<a href="https://tlu.tarilabs.com/consensus-mechanisms/consensus-mechanisms.html">Tari Labs University</a>.</p>
<p>From the point of view of a DAN committee, the ideal consensus algorithm is one that</p>
<ol>
<li>Allows a high number of transactions per second, and doesn't have unnecessary pauses (i.e. a partially synchronous or
asynchronous model).</li>
<li>Is Byzantine Fault tolerant.</li>
<li>Is relatively efficient from a network communication point of view (number of messages passed per state agreement).</li>
<li>Is relatively simple to implement (to reduce the bug and vulnerability surface in implementations).</li>
</ol>
<p>A summary of some of the most well-known BFT algorithms is presented in
<a href="https://tlu.tarilabs.com/consensus-mechanisms/BFT-consensus-mechanisms-applications/MainReport.html#summary-of-findings">this table</a>.</p>
<p>A close reading of the algorithms presented suggest that <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.01829.pdf">LinBFT</a>, which is based
on <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.05069" title="Hotstuff BFT">HotStuff</a> BFT provide the best trade-offs for the goals that a DAN committee is trying to achieve:</p>
<ol>
<li>The algorithm is optimistic, i.e. as soon as quorum is reached on a particular state, the committee can move onto the
next one. There is no need to wait for the &quot;timeout&quot; period as we do in e.g. Tendermint. This allows instructions to
be executed almost as quickly as they are received.</li>
<li>The algorithm is efficient in communication, requiring O(n) messages per state agreement in most practical cases.
This is compared to e.g. PBFT which requires O(n<sup>4</sup>) messages.</li>
<li>The algorithm is modular and relatively simple to implement.</li>
</ol>
<p>Potential drawbacks to using HotStuff include:</p>
<ol>
<li>Each round required the election of a <em>leader</em>. Having a leader dramatically simplifies the consensus algorithm; it
allows a linear number of messages to be sent between the leader and the other replicas in order to agree on the
current state; and it allows a strict ordering to be established on instructions without having to resort to e.g.
proof of work. However, if the choice of leader is deterministic, attackers can identify and potentially DDOS the
leader for a given round, causing the algorithm to time out. There are ways to mitigate this attack for a <em>specific
round</em>, as suggested in the LinBFT paper, such as using Verifiable Random Functions, but DDOSing a single replica
means that, on average, the algorithm will time out every 1/n rounds.</li>
<li>The attack described above only pauses progress in Hotstuff for the timeout period. In similar protocols, e.g.
Tendermint it can be shown to <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.05069">delay progress indefinitely</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Given these trade-offs, there is strong evidence to suggest that <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.05069" title="Hotstuff BFT">HotStuff</a> BFT, when implemented on the Tari DAN will
provide BFT security guarantees with liveness performance in the sub-second scale and throughput on the order of
thousands of instructions per second, if the benchmarks presented in the <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.05069" title="Hotstuff BFT">HotStuff</a> paper are representative.</p>
<h3 id="implementation-1"><a class="header" href="#implementation-1">Implementation</a></h3>
<p>The <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.05069" title="Hotstuff BFT">HotStuff</a> BFT algorithm provides a detailed description of the consensus algorithm. Only a summary of it is
presented here. To reduce confusion, we adopt the HotStuff nomenclature to describe state changes, rounds and function
names where appropriate.</p>
<p>Every proposed state change, as a result of replicas receiving instructions from clients is called a <em>view</em>. There is a
<a href="RFC-0340_VNConsensusOverview.html#leader-selection">function that every node can call</a> that will tell it which replica will be the <em>leader</em> for a given
view. Every view goes through three phases (<code>Prepare</code>, <code>PreCommit</code>, <code>Commit</code>) before final consensus is reached. Once a
view reaches the <code>Commit</code> phase, it is finalised and will never be reversed.</p>
<p>As part of their normal operation, every replica broadcasts <a href="Glossary.html#instructions">instructions</a> it receives for its contract to its peers.
These instructions are stored in a replica's instruction mempool.</p>
<p>When the <a href="RFC-0340_VNConsensusOverview.html#leader-selection">leader selection</a> function designates a replica as leader for the next view, it will try
and execute <em>all</em> the instructions it currently has in its mempool to update the state for the next view. Following this
it compiles a tuple of &lt;<em>valid-instructions</em>, <em>rejected-instructions</em>, <em>new-state</em>&gt;. This tuple represents the <code>CMD</code>
structure described in <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.05069" title="Hotstuff BFT">HotStuff</a>.</p>
<p>In parallel with this, the leader expects a set of <code>NewView</code> messages from the other replicas, indicating that the other
replicas know that this replica is the leader for the next view.</p>
<p>Once a super-majority of these messages have been received, the leader composes a proposal for the next state by adding
a new node to the state history graph (I'm calling it a state history graph to avoid naming confusion, but it's really a
blockchain). It composes a message containing the new proposal, and broadcasts it to the other replicas.</p>
<p>Replicas, on receipt of the proposal, decide whether the proposal is valid, both from a protocol point of view (i.e. did
the leader provide a well-formed proposal) as well as whether they agree on the new state (e.g. by executing the
instructions as given and comparing the resulting state with that of the proposal). If there is agreement, they vote on
the proposal by signing it, and sending their partial signature back to the leader.</p>
<p>When the leader has received a super-majority of votes, it sends a message back to the replicas with the (aggregated)
set of signatures.</p>
<p>Replicas can validate this signature and provide another partial signature indicating that they've received the first
aggregated signature for the proposal.</p>
<p>At this point, all replicas know that enough other replicas have received the proposal and are in agreement that it is
valid.</p>
<p>In Tendermint, replicas would now wait for the timeout period to make sure that the proposal wasn't going to be
superseded before finalising the proposal. But there is an attack described in the <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.05069" title="Hotstuff BFT">HotStuff</a> paper that could stall
progress at this point.</p>
<p>The HotStuff protocol prevents this by having a final round of confirmations with the leader. This prevents the stalling
attack and <em>also</em> lets replicas finalise the proposal <em>immediately</em> on receipt of the final confirmation from the
leader. This lets HotStuff proceed at &quot;network&quot; speed, rather than with a heartbeat dictated by the BFT synchronicity
parameter.</p>
<p>Although there are 4 round trips of communication between replicas and the leader, the number of messages sent are O(n).
It's also possible to stagger and layer these rounds on top of each other, so that there are always four voting rounds
happening simultaneously, rather than waiting for one to complete in its entirety before moving onto the next one.
Further details are given in the <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.05069" title="Hotstuff BFT">HotStuff</a> paper.</p>
<h4 id="forks-and-byzantine-failures"><a class="header" href="#forks-and-byzantine-failures">Forks and byzantine failures</a></h4>
<p>The summary of the HotStuff protocol given above describes the &quot;Happy Path&quot;, when there are no breakdowns in
communication, or when the leader is an honest node. In cases where the leader is unavailable, the protocol will time
out, the current view will be abandoned, and all replicas will move onto the next view.</p>
<p>If a leader is not honest, replicas will reject its proposal, and move onto the next view.</p>
<p>If there is a temporary network partition, the chain may fork (up to a depth of three), but the protocol guarantees
safety via the voting mechanism, and the chain will reconcile once the partition resolves.</p>
<h4 id="leader-selection"><a class="header" href="#leader-selection">Leader selection</a></h4>
<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.05069" title="Hotstuff BFT">HotStuff</a> leaves the leader selection algorithm to the application. Usually, a round-robin approach is suggested for
its simplicity. However, this requires the replicas to <em>reliably</em> self-order themselves before starting with SMR, which
is a non-trivial exercise in byzantine conditions.</p>
<p>For Tari DAN committees, the following algorithm is proposed:</p>
<ol>
<li>Every replica knows the <a href="Glossary.html#node-id">Node ID</a> of every other replica in the committee.</li>
<li>For a given <em>view number</em>, the Node ID with the closest XOR distance to the hash of the <em>view number</em> will be the
leader for that view, where the hash function provides a uniformly random value of the same length as the Node ID.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="quorum-certificate"><a class="header" href="#quorum-certificate">Quorum Certificate</a></h4>
<p>A Quorum certificate, or QC is proof that a super-majority of replicas have agreed on a given state. In particular, a QC
consists of</p>
<ul>
<li>The type of QC (depending on the phase in which the HotStuff pipeline the QC was signed),</li>
<li>The <em>view number</em> for the QC</li>
<li>A reference to the node in the state tree being ratified,</li>
<li>A signature from a super-majority of replicas.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="tari-specific-considerations"><a class="header" href="#tari-specific-considerations">Tari-specific considerations</a></h3>
<p>As soon as a state is finalised, replicas can inform clients as to the result of instructions they have submitted (in
the affirmative or negative). Given that HotStuff proceeds optimistically, and finalisation happens after 4 rounds of
communication, it's anticipated that clients can receive a final response from the validator committee in under 500 ms
for reasonably-sized committees (this value is speculation at present and will be updated once exploratory experiments
have been carried out).</p>
<p>The Tari communication platform was designed to handle peer-to-peer messaging of the type described in <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.05069" title="Hotstuff BFT">HotStuff</a>, and
therefore the protocol implementation should be relatively straightforward.</p>
<p>The &quot;state&quot; agreed upon by the VN committee will not only include the smart-contract state, but instruction fee
allocations and periodic checkpoints onto the base layer.</p>
<p>Checkpoints onto the base layer achieve several goals:</p>
<ul>
<li>Offers a proof-of-work backstop against &quot;evil committees&quot;. Without proof of work, there's nothing stopping an evil
committee (one that controls a super-majority of replicas) from rewriting history. Proof-of-work is the only reliable
and practical method that currently exists to make it expensive to change the history of a chain of records. Tari
gives us a &quot;best of both worlds&quot; scenario wherein an evil committee would have to rewrite the base layer history
(which <em>does</em> use proof-of-work) before they could rewrite the digital asset history (which does not).</li>
<li>They allow the asset issuer to authorise changes in the VN committee replica set.</li>
<li>It allows asset owners to have an immutable proof of asset ownership long after the VN committee has dissolved after
the useful end-of-life of a smart contract.</li>
<li>Provides a means for an asset issuer to resurrect a smart contract long after the original contract has terminated.</li>
</ul>
<p>When Validator Nodes run smart contracts, they should be run in a separate thread so that if a smart contract crashes,
it does not bring the consensus algorithm down with it.</p>
<p>Furthermore, VNs should be able to quickly revert state to at least four views back in order to handle temporary forks.
Nodes should also be able to initialise/resume a smart contract (e.g. from a crash) given a state, view number, and view
history.</p>
<p>This implies that VNs, in addition to passing around HotStuff BFT messages, will expose additional APIs in order to</p>
<ul>
<li>allow lagging replicas to catch up in the execution state.</li>
<li>Provide information to (authorised) clients regarding the most recent finalised state of the smart contract via a
read-only API.</li>
<li>Accept smart-contract instructions from clients and forward these onto the other replicas in the VN committee.</li>
</ul>

<p>The base layer is slow. The DAN is fast. However, every DAN instruction that results in a state change has a fee (i.e.
base layer transaction) associated with it.<br />
To bridge the speed gap between the two layers, a payment channel solution is required.<br />
This document provides the high-level overview of how this is done.</p>
<h3 id="the-clacks"><a class="header" href="#the-clacks">The Clacks</a></h3>
<p>The Clacks is a multi-party side-channel off-chain scalability proposal for Tari. The essential idea behind the Clacks
is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Users give control of some Tari to a Clacks Committee.</li>
<li>The committee creates an off-chain UTXO for the user(s). This is called the peg-in transaction.</li>
<li>Users can transact amongst each other without those transactions touching the base layer. This allows a very high
throughput of transactions and instant finality. However, the locus of trust move significantly towards the Clacks
committee. In other words, base layer transactions are slow, but do not require users to trust anyone. Clacks
transactions are fast, but requires some level of trust in the entity or entities controlling the user's funds.</li>
<li>Users can send off-chain Tari to any other users, including users that have not made deposits into the Clacks
committee.</li>
<li>Users can request a withdrawal for their Tari at any time. At predefined intervals, the Clacks committee will process
those withdrawal requests and give the Tari UTXO control back to the user.</li>
</ul>
<p>Users also have a pre-signed, time-locked transaction that returns the user's fund back to them. This refund transaction
can be used in case the Clacks committee stops processing withdrawals and provides insurance for users against having
their funds locked up forever.</p>
<p>The peg-in, peg-out cycle are represented by standard Tari transactions. This means that full nodes verify that no funds
have been created or destroyed over the course of the cycle. They do not check that the &quot;balances&quot; associated with users
are what those users would expect in an honestly run side chain.</p>
<p>However, if the side-chain is run as a standard mimblewimble process, any third party running a full node and that
access to the opening and closing channel balances, can in fact verify that the committee has operated honestly.</p>

their respective blockchains.</p>

<p>Mining on the Tari Base Layer consists of three primary entities: the Base Nodes, Mining Servers and Mining Workers. 
A description of the Base Node is provided in <a href="https://tari-project.github.io/tari/RFC-0110_BaseNodes.html">RFC-0110/Base Nodes</a>.
A Mining Server is connected locally or remotely to a Tari Base Node and a Monero Node, and is responsible for 
constructing Tari and Monero Blocks from their respective mempools. The Mining Server should retrieve transactions 
from the mempool of the connected Base Node and assemble a new Tari block by bundling transactions together.</p>
<p>Mining servers may re-verify transactions before including them in a new Tari block, but this enforcement of 
verification and transaction rules such as signatures and timelocks is the responsibility of the connected Base Node. 
Mining Servers are responsible for <a href="RFC-0140_Syncing_and_seeding.html#pruning-and-cut-through">cut-through</a>, as this is required for scalability and privacy.</p>
<p>To enable merged mining of Tari with Monero, both a Tari and a Monero block need to be created and linked. First, 
a new Tari block is created and then the block header hash of the new Tari block is included in the coinbase 
transaction of the new Monero block. Once a new merged mined Monero block has been constructed, PoW tasks can 
be sent to the connected Mining Workers, which will attempt to solve the block by performing the latest released 
version of the PoW algorithm selected by Monero.</p>
<p>Assuming the Tari difficulty is less than the Monero difficulty, miners get rewarded for solving the PoW at any 
difficulty above the Tari difficulty. If the block is solved above the Tari difficulty, a new Tari block is mined. 
If the difficulty is also greater than the Monero difficulty, a new Monero block is mined as well. In either event, 
the header for the candidate Monero block is included in the Tari block header.</p>
<p>If the PoW solution was sufficient to meet the difficult level of both the Tari and Monero blockchains, then the 
individual blocks for each blockchain can be sent from the Mining Server to the Base Node and Monero Node to be 
added to the respective blockchains.</p>
<p>Every Tari block must include the solved Monero block's information (block header hash, Merkle tree branch and 
hash of the coinbase transaction) in the PoW summary section of the Tari block header. 
If the PoW solution found by the Mining Workers only solved the problem at the Tari difficulty, the Monero block can be discarded. </p>
<p>This process will ensure that the Tari difficulty remains independent. Adjusting the difficulty will ensure that 
the Tari block times are preserved. Also, the Tari block time can be less than, equal to or greater than the Monero block 
times. A more detailed description of the merged mining process between a Primary and Auxiliary blockchain is provided 
in the <a href="https://tlu.tarilabs.com/merged-mining/merged-mining.html">Merged Mining TLU report</a>.</p>
